<p><span class="smcap">My dear little Friends</span>,</p>

<p>You will no doubt be surprised to find
this book commencing with a perfectly serious
poem, and one which probably some of you
will find a little difficulty in understanding.
When you have grown older, however, and
happen to look at this little book again, you
will be glad to be reminded of the historic
event which the poem commemorates. Now,
about ourselves, when I asked in my last book,
<em>The Missing Prince</em>, for letters from my little
readers, I had no idea that I had so many
young friends, and I can hardly tell you how
delighted I have been at receiving such a
number of kind letters from all parts of the
world.</p>

<p>I do hope that I have answered everyone,
but really there have been so many, and if by
mistake any should have been overlooked, I
hope my little correspondents will write again
and give me an opportunity of repairing the
omission.</p>

<p>Such charming little letters, and all, I am
happy to find, really written by the children
themselves, which makes them doubly valuable
to me.</p>

<p>And how funny and amusing some of them
were to be sure! And what capital stories
some of you have told me about your pets.</p>

<p>Some pathetic incidents too; as, for instance,
that of &lsquo;Shellyback,&rsquo; the tortoise, whose little
owner wrote a few months after her first letter
to say that poor &lsquo;Shellyback&rsquo; was dead.</p>

<p>I have been very happy to notice how fond
you all seem of your pets, for I have always
found that children who make friends with
animals invariably have kind and good hearts.
And the poor dumb creatures themselves are
always so ready to respond to any little act
of kindness, and are so grateful and affectionate,
that I am sure it adds greatly to one&#8217;s happiness
in life to interest oneself in them.</p>

<p>One of my correspondents, aged eight, has
embarrassed me very much indeed by suggesting
that I should &ldquo;wait for her till she grows
up,&rdquo; as she should &ldquo;so like to marry a gentleman
who told stories.&rdquo; I hope she didn&#8217;t mean
that I did anything so disgraceful; and besides,
as it would take nearly twenty-five years for her
to catch up to me, she <em>might</em> change her mind
in that time, and then what would become of
me.</p>

<p>Some of my letters from abroad have been
very interesting. One dear little girl at Darjeeling,
in India, wrote a very nice descriptive
letter, and concluded by asking me to write
&ldquo;something about the stars,&rdquo; and speaking of
new stories brings me to another subject that
I wish to talk to you about.</p>

<p>You know that I spoke in my last book
about writing a school story, and one about
animals. Well, when I found that so many of
you wanted to hear &ldquo;more about the Wallypug,&rdquo;
I was obliged to put these two books
aside in order to gratify your wishes. I hope
that you will be as interested in hearing about
his Majesty this time as you were last.</p>

<p>You will be sure to notice that the pictures
are by another artist, but Mr. Harry Furniss
has been away from England for some months,
and so it has been impossible for him to illustrate
this volume. Some other time, perhaps,
Dorothy and he will give us more of their
work; but in the meantime Mr. Alan Wright
has been very interested in drawing pictures
for this book, and I hope you will be pleased
with his efforts.</p>

<p>Now, about writing to me next time. When
I asked you to address me under care of my
publishers, I did not realize that in the course
of business I might find it necessary to change
them sometimes, and so to avoid any possibility
of confusion, will you please in future
address all letters to</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span class="smcap">Mr. G. E. Farrow</span>,<br />
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">c/o Messrs.</span> <span class="smcap">A. P. Watt &amp; Son</span>,<br />

                  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Norfolk Street, Strand.</span></p>

<p>What am I to do with all the beautiful
Christmas and New Year&#8217;s cards which I
have received? Will you be vexed if, after
having enjoyed receiving them as I have done
so much, I give them to the poor little children
at the hospitals to make scrap books with?
I happen to know how much they value and
appreciate gifts of this kind, and by allowing
me to bestow them in this way, your pretty
presents will be giving a double happiness.</p>

<p>Well, I must conclude this rather long letter
now, or I shall be accused of being tedious;
but really it gives me almost as much pleasure
to write to you, as it does to receive your letters.
Good-bye. Don&#8217;t forget that many of you
have promised to write to me again, and that
I am always more than glad to welcome any
new friends.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>HIS MAJESTY AND SUITE ARRIVE</strong></p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;most extraordinary thing
has happened; the Wallypug
has been to London!
But there, I am forgetting
that possibly you have
never read <em>The Wallypug
of Why</em>, in which case
you will, of course, know nothing about his
Majesty, and so I had better explain to you
who, and what, he is.</p>

<p>To begin with, then, he is a kind of king
of a place called Why, which adjoins the
mysterious kingdom of Zum. I am afraid,
though, that if you searched your atlases for
a very long while you might not find either of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
these places, for the geographers are so undecided
as to their exact position that they
have not shown them on the maps at all.
Some little friends of mine, named Girlie and
Boy, have been there, however, and I can tell
you, if you like, the way they went. This is
the way to Why:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
Just go to bed and shut your eyes<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And count one hundred, one by one;</span><br />
Perhaps you&#8217;ll find to your surprise<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">That you&#8217;re at Why when this is done.</span></p>

<p>I say <em>perhaps</em>, because this only happens when
you have been particularly good all day, and
<em>sometimes</em> boys and girls are not quite as good
as they&mdash;but there, I won&#8217;t say what I was
going to, for I am quite sure that it would not
apply to you. This is the way to Zum:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
Not when the moon is at its full,<br />
But just a tiny boat-shaped thing,<br />
You <em>may</em> see Pierrot sitting there<br />
And hear the little fellow sing.<br />
If so, just call him, and he&#8217;ll come<br />
And carry you away to Zum.</p>

<p>There, now, I&#8217;ve told you the way to go to
both places, so that, if you wish to, you can
go there whenever you please.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
I am telling you all this because one day
in the spring Girlie and Boy, who live in
another part of London, came to see me, and
we had been talking about these things for
about the hundredth time, I should think: for
these children are never tired of telling me of
all the strange things which happened to them
when they journey to these wonderful places.
In fact they were just arguing as to which
was the most interesting place to go to, Why
or Zum, when my housekeeper, Mrs. Putchy,
came to the door with the unwelcome news that
the carriage had come for my little friends, and
that it was time to say good-bye. After they
had gone I sat staring into the fire wondering
where Why could be, and if there was really
such a person as the Wallypug, when my little
dog Dick, who had been lying on the rug
before the fire, suddenly jumped up, and
barking excitedly, ran to the other end of the
study, where a picture, which I had bought the
day before at an auction sale, stood leaning
against the wall. Now this picture had been
sold very cheap, because no one could tell at
all what it was about, it was so old and dusty,
and the colours were so dark and indistinct.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
I had bought it hoping that it might prove
valuable, and there it stood till it could be
sent to be cleaned and restored. Imagine my
surprise then, when, on following Dick across
the study, I discovered that the colours in the
picture had all become bright, and were working
one into the other in the most remarkable
way, red running into green, and blue into
yellow, while a little patch of black in the
centre of the picture was whirling round and
round in quite a distracting manner. What
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
could it all mean? I stared and wondered,
till, out of the confusion, there gradually grew
shapes which bore some resemblance to human
beings, and, presently, I could recognize quite
distinctly, first a young man in knee breeches,
smiling in a particularly self-satisfied way, and
escorting a large fish, who was walking upright,
with slippers on his tail, and who wore
a waistcoat and necktie. Then an amiable-looking
old gentleman, carrying a wand, who
was followed by a curious little person, wearing
a crown and carrying an orb and sceptre. A
particularly stiff and wooden-looking soldier
stood at the back of this strange group. Judge
of my amazement when, quite as a matter of
course, the whole party deliberately stepped
out of the picture into the room, and, before
I could realize what had happened, the old
gentleman with the wand came forward with a
flourish and an elaborate bow, and announced:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A-hem! his Majesty the Wallypug of Why
and suite.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 317px;">
<img src="images/img004.png" width="317" height="400" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">with slippers on his tail</span>
</div>

<p>I was so astonished that for the moment I
could not think what to say, but at last I
managed to stammer, as I made a low bow to
the Wallypug:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am delighted to make your Majesty&#8217;s
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wallypug smiled very affably, and held
out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come up for the Jubilee, you know,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>We&#8217;ve</em> come up, you mean to say, Wallypug,&rdquo;
corrected the old gentleman with the
wand, frowning somewhat severely. &ldquo;I am
the Wallypug&#8217;s professional adviser,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;I am called the Doctor-in-Law&mdash;allow
me to introduce the rest of our party.
This,&rdquo; he went on, bringing the young man
with the self-satisfied smile forward, &ldquo;is the
Jubilee Rhymester from Zum; he hopes to
become a minor poet in time. And this,&rdquo; indicating
the wooden-looking soldier, &ldquo;is Sergeant
One-and-Nine, also from Zum.&rdquo; Here the
Doctor-in-Law took me aside and whispered in
my ear, &ldquo;Slightly cracked, crossed in love;
speaks very peculiarly; capital chap though.&rdquo;
Then crossing to where the Fish was standing,
he said, &ldquo;And this is A. Fish, Esq., the celebrated
lecturer on the &lsquo;Whichness of the What
as compared with the Thatness of the Thus.&rsquo;
He desired to accompany us here in order to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
find material for a new lecture which he is
preparing upon the &lsquo;Perhapness of the Improbable.&rsquo;
He&#8217;s awfully clever,&rdquo; he whispered
impressively.</p>

<span class="caption">&ldquo;his majesty the wallypug&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m delighted to see you all,&rdquo; I
said, shaking hands with each one till I came
to the Fish, who held out a fin. &ldquo;Er-er-how
do you do?&rdquo; I stammered, somewhat taken
aback by this strange proceeding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quide well with the egscebtiod of a slide
cold id by head,&rdquo; said the Fish. &ldquo;I&#8217;b subjecd
to theb, you doe. It&#8217;s beig id the water so
butch, I fadcy,&rdquo; and he <em>smiled</em>.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if you have ever seen a fish
smile, but if not I may tell you that it is a
very curious sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you can manage to put us up
here for a month or two?&rdquo; calmly suggested
the Doctor-in-Law after a pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; I exclaimed in alarm, &ldquo;I don&#8217;t
think my housekeeper could possibly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not ask her?&rdquo; suggested the Doctor-in-Law,
touching the bell.</p>

<p>A moment or two afterwards a knock at the
door announced that Mrs. Putchy was there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Putchy,&rdquo; I said, stepping just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
outside, &ldquo;these gentlemen, er&mdash;that is to
say, his Majesty the Wallypug of Why and
suite, have honoured me with a visit, and
I am anxious if possible to offer them such
hospitality as my poor home affords. Do you
think that we could manage anyhow to find
room for them, for a few days at any rate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Putchy is a very remarkable
woman, and I have never known her to show
the slightest surprise at anything, and, so far
from seeming alarmed at the prospect of having
to entertain such notable visitors, she seemed
positively delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Majesty of Why, sir? How charming!
Of course we must do our best, and how
fortunate that I put on my best gown to-day,
isn&#8217;t it? Dear me, and shall I be presented
to his Majesty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Mrs. Putchy, if you wish it,&rdquo; I
said. &ldquo;In fact, if you will call General Mary
Jane, I will introduce you both, as you represent
my entire household.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Putchy disappeared, returning almost
immediately, followed by the servant, General
Mary Jane, with her mouth wide open, and
accompanied by the cat, who rejoices in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
extraordinary name of Mrs. Mehetable Murchison.
These members of my household were
duly presented to the Wallypug. Mrs. Putchy
made her curtsey with great dignity, but
General Mary Jane was so overcome at the
thought of being presented to royalty that she
fell flat on her hands and knees in her humility,
while Mrs. Mehetable Murchison, realizing, no
doubt, the truth of the old saying that &ldquo;a cat
may look at a king,&rdquo; went up and sharpened
her claws on the Wallypug&#8217;s legs in the most
friendly manner possible.</p>

<p>It was when the cat caught sight of A. Fish,
Esq., that she completely lost her presence of
mind, and with arched back and bristling fur
glared at him in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Priddy pussy, cub alog thed,&rdquo; said the
Fish, stooping down and trying to stroke her
with one of his fins; but Mrs. Mehetable
Murchison, with a startled glance, tore out of
the room, showing every sign of alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she&#8217;s so fond of fish too, as a rule,
ain&#8217;t she, mum?&rdquo; remarked General Mary
Jane, who had somewhat overcome the awe
with which she had at first regarded the presence
of royalty.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
&ldquo;Fod of fish?&rdquo; repeated A. Fish, Esq.,
inquiringly. &ldquo;What do you mead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, sir,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Putchy,
&ldquo;we often have fish for dinner&mdash;er&mdash;that is to
say&mdash;er&mdash;a-hem!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 321px;">
<img src="images/img006.png" width="321" height="400" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;priddy pussy&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>The Fish was glaring at her in a horrified
way, and Mrs. Putchy had become quite
nervous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&#8217;s change the subject,&rdquo; suggested the
Doctor-in-Law, to our great relief. &ldquo;The most
important question for the moment is, where
are we all going to sleep?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
This gave Mrs. Putchy an opportunity for
exercising her wonderful ability for management,
and after arranging for the Wallypug to
have the spare bedroom, and the Doctor-in-Law
to have my room, I was to have a bed
made up in the study, while the Jubilee Rhymester
was to sleep in the attic, One-and-Nine
was to have a box under the stairs, and there
only remained A. Fish, Esq., to dispose of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is the bathroom, mum,&rdquo; suggested
General Mary Jane brilliantly; &ldquo;we could put
a lid on the bath and make up a bed there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bedder sdill, fill id with wadter, ad thed
I could sleeb <em>in</em> id,&rdquo; suggested the Fish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course!&rdquo; said Mrs. Putchy,
&ldquo;and now I must go and see about the supper.&rdquo;
And, with a low curtsey to the Wallypug, the
admirable little woman hurried out, followed by
General Mary Jane, who gave a nervous little
bob when she reached the door.</p>

<p>They had scarcely disappeared before One-and-Nine
came up to me and whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am muchly impressionated by that lady
with the most militaryish name who has just
gone out. Can you kindly inform me is she
detached?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
&ldquo;Detached?&rdquo; I inquired in bewilderment.
&ldquo;What ever do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a person is not attached to anyone else,
they are detached, I suppose, are they not?&rdquo;
said One-and-Nine rather impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you put it that way, I suppose they
are,&rdquo; I replied, laughing. &ldquo;You mean, has she
a sweetheart? Well, really I don&#8217;t know. I
have an idea though that Mrs. Putchy does not
allow followers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I shall considerize my prospectuousness
with great hopefulosity!&rdquo; remarked the
soldier with considerable dignity, walking back
to the Wallypug&#8217;s chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; asked the Jubilee
Rhymester. &ldquo;He is a little bit cracked, you
know. Could you make out what he was
driving at?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I could understand within a little
what he meant,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;He seems to
have fallen in love with General Mary Jane
at first sight, from what I can gather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really! Dear me! He is always doing
that sort of thing, do you know, and he
generally asks me to write poems for him
when he gets into that state. I have written
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
as many as 137 odes in one month on his
behalf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and does he
pay you well for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay me!&rdquo; exclaimed the Jubilee Rhymester,
staring at me in surprise. &ldquo;Of course not.
Do people ever get paid for writing poetry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, to be sure they do,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;ve never heard of such a thing in
all my life,&rdquo; said the Jubilee Rhymester; &ldquo;I
always thought that poets had to pay to have
their verses used at all, and that that was why
they were always so poor while they were
alive. Of course I knew that people sometimes
made a fuss about them after they were
dead, but I have never heard of such a thing
as a live poet being paid for his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I believe that quite
a lot of money is sometimes paid by the
magazines and other papers for poems and
verses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am delighted to hear it,&rdquo; said the
Jubilee Rhymester, &ldquo;and I shall certainly start
writing to-morrow. I have no doubt whatever
that I shall make my fortune before I go back
to Zum.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Shortly after this Mrs. Putchy announced
that supper was served, and a little later my
guests retired to rest, being thoroughly tired
out with their long journey. I sat up in my
study a little while longer to smoke a pipe,
but was just thinking of going to bed when
there was a tap at the door and the Doctor-in-Law
entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, I thought I had better come and
arrange with you about money matters,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;I didn&#8217;t like to mention such things
before the others. Now then,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;how much are you going to pay us for staying
with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay <em>you</em>!&rdquo; I gasped. &ldquo;What on earth do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, it will be a great thing
for you to have such distinguished visitors,
don&#8217;t you know, and you ought to be quite
willing to pay liberally for the honour,&rdquo; said
the Doctor-in-Law, smiling amiably.</p>

<p>Now Girlie had told me what a greedy,
avaricious person the Doctor-in-Law really
was, despite his benevolent appearance, but this
cool cheek almost took my breath away. I
was determined, however, to let him see at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
once that I was not to be imposed upon, so I
said as firmly as I could, &ldquo;Now, look here,
Mr. Doctor-in-Law, please understand once
and for all, that as you were all so kind to my
little friend Girlie when she was at Why, I
am quite willing to entertain his Majesty the
Wallypug, and the rest of you, to the very best
of my ability, but as for paying you for being
here, the idea is absurd&mdash;impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img007.png" width="400" height="354" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;id quide gave be a turn&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Just then a terrific hullabaloo in the passage
caused us both to run to the door. We could
hear that the noise proceeded from the bathroom,
and, hurrying to the door, we found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
A. Fish, Esq., sitting up in the water shouting
for help, while Mrs. Mehetable Murchison
and a whole group of her feline friends were
out on the tiles, glaring through the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear be, dear be,&rdquo; panted the Fish, when
he saw us, &ldquo;I&#8217;b so frighteded, just look at all
those cats. I had beed to sleeb ad was just
dreabig that sobeone was sayig, &lsquo;Mrs. Behetable

have fish for didder,&rsquo; whed I woke ub and saw
all those horrible cats lookig id ad the widdow;
id quide gave be a turn. Do drive theb
away please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We soon did this, and, pulling down the
blinds, we left A. Fish, Esq., to his dreams
and soon afterwards retired to rest ourselves.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE NEXT DAY&#8217;S ADVENTURES</strong></p>


<p>When I entered the breakfast room the
next morning I found that the Wallypug
and the Doctor-in-Law had been up for some
time, and were both gazing out of the window
with the greatest of interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope your Majesty slept well,&rdquo; I remarked
to the Wallypug as I approached
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well indeed, thank you,&rdquo; he replied
smilingly. &ldquo;The Doctor-in-Law and myself
have just been saying that we are sure to
have an enjoyable visit here. We have been
greatly interested in the man-machines going
past. We have never seen anything like them
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man-machines!&rdquo; I exclaimed, puzzled
to know whatever he could mean.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, the men with wheels instead of legs,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean the bicyclists,&rdquo; I replied,
laughing. &ldquo;Have you really never seen any
before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied his Majesty. &ldquo;Are
they born with wheels on, or do they grow
afterwards?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughed, and fortunately just then the
youngster opposite, who always rides to school
on his bicycle, came out of doors wheeling
his machine, and I was able to explain to the
Wallypug the principle upon which they worked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me; the Doctor-in-Law told me that
the machinery was part of the man, but now I
see that it is separate. And he charged me
sixpence for the information too,&rdquo; he complained,
looking reproachfully at the Doctor-in-Law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charged you sixpence!&rdquo; I cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the poor Wallypug. &ldquo;He
offered to tell me all about them for sixpence,
and as I was really very curious to know I gave
it to him, and then he informed me that they
were a peculiar race of people who came from
Coventry, and who were all born with wheels
instead of legs.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
&ldquo;Take your old sixpence then, if you are
going to make all that fuss about it,&rdquo; said the
Doctor-in-Law, crossly, throwing the coin down
on the table and walking out of the room in
a huff. &ldquo;I&#8217;m sure I did read somewhere that
they came from Coventry,&rdquo; he added, popping
his head in at the door and then slamming it
violently after him.</p>

<p>The boy opposite was still riding up and
down the road, and I made up my mind that
although I had never spoken to him before,
I would ask him to let the Wallypug examine
his bicycle more closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; he replied, raising his hat
politely to the Wallypug, when I had explained
who he was; &ldquo;and if his Majesty would like
to try it he is quite welcome to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor-in-Law&#8217;s curiosity had so far
overcome his ill-humour that, when he saw us
talking to the boy, he came forward and offered
to help the Wallypug to mount.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really don&#8217;t think he had better,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;he might damage the machine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh no, he won&#8217;t hurt it, I&#8217;m sure,&rdquo; said
the boy generously; and so with our united
assistance the Wallypug got on to the bicycle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and after a few preliminary wobblings started
off in fine style. Faster and faster he went,
clinging desperately to the handle-bars, till
we, who were running beside him, could no
longer keep pace with him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img008.png" width="400" height="341" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">the start</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I can&#8217;t stop,&rdquo; we heard him shout; and a
moment later he charged straight at a large
stone and half a brick which lay in the middle
of the roadway.</p>

<p>Poor Wallypug! The sudden impact threw
him right over the handle-bars, and he landed
in a huddled heap on his hands and knees in
the gutter. The machine flew in half, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
front portion careered madly away by itself
till stopped by the kerb.</p>

<p>We hurried up to his Majesty to discover if
he was much hurt, but, with the exception of
a few scratches on his hands and knees and a
thorough shaking, he seemed to have come off
pretty well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img009.png" width="400" height="273" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">the finish</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we can&#8217;t stick it together again?&rdquo;
he inquired, gazing ruefully at the broken
bicycle, and I was obliged to tell him that
there was not much chance of our doing so.
The boy to whom it belonged bravely made
the best of the matter, especially when I told
him that the next half-holiday he had I would
take him to Holborn to choose another one
in its place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
And when I discovered that he had a half-holiday
that very afternoon, it was arranged
that General Mary Jane should order a carriage
at the livery stable, and that we should
all drive to the city after luncheon.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 300px;">

<span class="caption">hippety-hoppety-plop</span>
</div>

<p>The Wallypug, after a good wash and a
hearty breakfast, went to his room to lie down
for an hour or two to recover from the effects
of his accident, and I was just answering my
morning letters when there was a knock at
the study door, and the Rhymester entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sat up most of the night writing poetry,&rdquo;
he remarked, &ldquo;and I
have just brought you
one or two specimens.
The first one is called
&lsquo;The Ode of a Toad.&rsquo;
Perhaps I had better
read it to you. My
writing is rather
peculiar,&rdquo; and he began as follows:</p>

<p class="center">THE ODE OF A TOAD.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
There was once an old toad who lived under a tree,<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hippety hop&mdash;Flippety flop,</span><br />
And his head was as bald as bald could be,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
He was deaf as a post and could hardly see,<br />
But a giddy and frivolous toad was he,<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">With his hippety-hoppety-plop.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
And he gambolled and danced on the village green,<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hippety hop&mdash;Flippety flop,</span><br />
In a way that had never before been seen,<br />
Tho&#8217; he wasn&#8217;t so young as once he had been,<br />
And the people all wondered whate&#8217;er he could mean,<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">With his hippety-hoppety-plop.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
But the old chap kept bobbing about just the same,<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hippety hop&mdash;Flippety flop,</span><br />
Till everyone thought he <em>must</em> make himself lame,<br />
And not a soul ever could find out his aim,<br />
In keeping up such a ridiculous game,<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">As his hippety-hoppety-plop.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">
Some said he was mad, tho&#8217; as mild as a dove,<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hippety hop&mdash;Flippety flop,</span><br />
And as the result of a push or a shove,<br />
Was a little bit cracked in the storey above,<br />
<em>But I fancy myself the old boy was in love</em>,<br />
        <span style="margin-left: 4em;">With his hippety-hoppety-plop.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There! What do you think of it?&rdquo; he
asked when he had finished.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img011.png" width="250" height="233" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;i love but thee&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Well, candidly, I&#8217;m afraid not very much,&rdquo;
I replied; &ldquo;and what on earth do you call it
an ode for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, ode went so well with the
word toad. I was going to call it &lsquo;Ode to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Toad,&rsquo; but it isn&#8217;t <em>to</em> a toad at all, though it&#8217;s
about a toad. Ah! by the bye, I might call
it &lsquo;A Toad&#8217;s Ode,&rsquo; mightn&#8217;t
I? I think that sounds
very jolly.&rdquo; He altered
the title in pencil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have another which
I think you will say is
very touching.&rdquo; And after
getting his handkerchief
out in case he should be moved to tears, he
began:</p>

<p class="center">THE BALLADE OF A BUN.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 11.5em;">
Don&#8217;t talk to me of &ldquo;Sally Lunn,&rdquo;<br />

<p>&ldquo;Isn&#8217;t it affecting?&rdquo; he inquired, wiping his
eyes when he had finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I didn&#8217;t quite appreciate
the pathos of it as I might have done,&rdquo; I
answered, trying hard not to laugh. &ldquo;You
see I was paying so much attention to the
scansion. I find that you have altered the
refrain in the Envoy. Surely that&#8217;s not correct,
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are a great deal too particular,&rdquo;
remarked the Rhymester crossly. &ldquo;Why, I
should think from the Doctor-in-Law&#8217;s description
of a critic that you must be one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say a critic was?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why, he said a critic was a person who
found fault with another, for not doing what
he was unable to do himself. And he charged
me fourpence three-farthings for the information,
and as I only had fourpence halfpenny I
have to pay him the odd farthing when I sell
some of my poems. Can you tell me how I
can set to work about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I hardly know,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;unless
you send them to the editors of the various
magazines. They may take them, but you
must not be disappointed if some of them are
rejected. You see they cannot possibly print
everything that is sent to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were several magazines in the study,
and I suggested that the Rhymester should
make a list of the addresses of the various
editors, and he was busy about that till luncheon
time.</p>

<p>At half-past two the carriage came to the
door, and goodness only knows what General
Mary Jane must have told the livery stable
people about the Wallypug, for, evidently
anxious to send an equipage worthy of royalty,
they had painted an enormous monogram in
gold on the sides of the carriage, while the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
coachman was resplendent in blue plush and
gold lace, with silk stockings and a powdered
wig.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img012.png" width="600" height="371" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;equipageous grandiosity&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>The Wallypug was delighted when he saw
this elaborate turn-out, and so were the others,
for I overheard One-and-Nine murmuring
something about &ldquo;equipageous grandiosity,&rdquo;
as he climbed up to the seat beside the coachman.
When the Wallypug, the Doctor-in-Law,
A. Fish, Esq., and the Rhymester, were
seated, there was no room left for the boy
and myself, so we followed behind in a modest
dog-cart, which was hurriedly procured from
the livery stable. Many were the wondering
glances bestowed upon the carriage, with its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
somewhat remarkable burden, as we drove
along through Kensington to the Gardens.
And everywhere our appearance was hailed with
enthusiasm, people being evidently under the
impression that the Wallypug was one of the
royal guests invited to the Jubilee festivities.
Who could he be? That was decidedly the
question which everyone was asking, and I
could not quite determine who was causing the
greater sensation, the Wallypug or A. Fish,
Esq. These two individuals, however, comported
themselves with the calmest dignity,
only the Doctor-in-Law seemed flurried by the
attention which they attracted, and smiled and
bowed right and left, whether the people took
any notice of him or not.</p>

<p>As we approached Hyde-Park corner attention
was diverted from the Wallypug&#8217;s carriage
by the fact that <em>another</em> royal equipage had
entered the Park gates; and as the Princess
passed us, an amused glance and a whispered
conversation with the other occupant of the
carriage showed that the Wallypug&#8217;s extraordinary
party had not escaped Her Royal
Highness&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>After going once round the Park we went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
out at the Marble Arch and along Oxford
Street to Holborn, our progress through the
crowded streets everywhere attracting the most
excited interest. And when we stopped before
one of the large bicycle <em>dep&ocirc;ts</em> in Holborn the
crowd around the carriage was so large that the
policeman had quite a difficulty in preventing
a block in the traffic. Our business was soon
transacted, and, having secured an excellent
machine for the boy in place of the one which
his Majesty had damaged in the morning, we
drove back to Kensington without further adventure.</p>

<p>The Wallypug&#8217;s curiosity, however, was so
awakened by what he had seen that, as soon
as we had been refreshed by a cup of afternoon
tea, he suggested that we should go out for
a walk; accordingly the whole party proceeded
to Kensington Gardens, followed by a curious
and somewhat derisive crowd of small boys,
who would insist upon advising the Wallypug
to &ldquo;get his hair cut.&rdquo; Now, I happened to
know, from what Girlie had told me about
her adventures in Why, that the Wallypug,
though a kind of king, had to do as his people
directed and not as he liked, and that when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
he had presented a petition in Parliament to
be allowed to have his hair cut, they had
divided upon the subject, and so he had only
been allowed to have <em>half</em> of it cut, and as the
long half had by this time grown very long
indeed, he certainly did look rather remarkable;
that was no excuse though for the
street boys&#8217; rudeness, and his Majesty very
wisely took no notice of them. A. Fish, Esq.,
came in for the greatest amount of attention,
and when a few drops of rain began to fall,
and he put up an umbrella for fear that he
should get wet, the crowd became so excited
that the Doctor-in-Law wisely suggested that
a return should be made. His Majesty, however,
was bent upon sight-seeing, and so the
party separated, the Doctor-in-Law, A. Fish,
Esq., and One-and-Nine going home, while
the rest of us continued our walk. When we
reached the Gardens, the Wallypug was greatly
interested in seeing the palace where the
Queen was born, and said that he should certainly
petition his Parliament to allow him to
have soldiers walk up and down before the
gates of his palace, like those which he saw
here. He admired greatly Princess Louise&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
statue of the Queen, which stands in front of
the palace, and said he couldn&#8217;t imagine where-ever
they could have got all the white sugar
from to make it with, and I think that he was
inclined to disbelieve me when I told him that
it was not made of sugar at all, but of white
marble; for he said that if that were the case
he couldn&#8217;t think why they wanted to put
such high railings around it, as no one would
wish to carry away a marble statue of that
size, whereas, if it were sugar, as he suggested,
why, of course, the railings were there to prevent
the children from climbing up and breaking
off little pieces to eat.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 501px;">

<span class="caption">for fear he should get wet</span>
</div>

<p>The Round Pond and the little model ships
interested His Majesty most of all though, I
fancy, and he spent quite a long time admiring
them, until, while assisting a small boy to get
his ship ashore, he had the misfortune to slip
into the water himself, and had to be fished
out with the assistance of a boathook.</p>

<p>His Majesty certainly did not look either
dignified or regal as he stood on the bank
saturated with water, and his royal robes clinging
about him in the most woe-begone manner&mdash;and
as the crowd had greatly increased, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
was very glad to get the poor Wallypug into
a cab and drive home.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img014.png" width="600" height="364" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">his majesty has an accident</span>
</div>

<p>On our way there, the Rhymester, being
very much afraid of getting his clothes wet,
sat in the furthest corner of the cab and
amused himself by writing a verse on the subject
of his Majesty&#8217;s misfortune, which read
somehow like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;King George I&#8217;ve heard is King of Greece,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But since this luckless slipping,</span><br />
 The Wallypug I do declare<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should be the King of <em>Dripping</em>.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>I think his Majesty thought it rather unkind
of the Rhymester to make fun of him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
in this way, but before he had time to think
much about the matter, we had arrived at our
destination, and to my great surprise I could
see a vast crowd collected at the doors of the
building in which my flat is situated.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>SUNDRY SMALL HAPPENINGS</strong></p>


<p>Whatever could it all mean? The
Doctor-in-Law stood on the steps,
calling out, &ldquo;Walk up, walk up, ladies and
gentlemen, and see the Talking Fish,&rdquo; while
large posters were pasted on the walls, bearing
the words, &ldquo;Admission Sixpence&rdquo; and &ldquo;One
day only.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Commissionaire who usually stands at
the door was looking very surprised and angry,
while the page boy was grinning all over his
face. Whatever was happening? I hastily
paid the cabman, and followed by the Wallypug
made my way through the crowd to the
entrance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admission sixpence each,&rdquo; said the Doctor-in-Law,
holding out his hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/img015.png" width="447" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;walk up, walk up, ladies and gentlemen&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and
what is all this crowd doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Admission sixpence each!&rdquo; repeated the
Doctor-in-Law stubbornly, not taking the least
notice of my questions, and holding his wand
across the doorway so that I could not get in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;I&#8217;m not going to
pay to go into my own house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay for the Wallypug then and I&#8217;ll let
you in free,&rdquo; said the little man insinuatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; I cried,
pushing past him and hurrying up the stairs.</p>

<p>To my surprise I found my rooms occupied
by strangers. Sergeant One-and-Nine was
reciting some of the Rhymester&#8217;s poems in
the dining room to three deaf old ladies, two
of whom had ear trumpets, while A. Fish, Esq.,
was holding a kind of <em>lev&eacute;e</em> in my study, seated
in a chair placed on the writing table, and was
surrounded by an admiring crowd of people
who were asking all sorts of questions.</p>

<p>Mrs. Putchy met me at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&#8217;m so glad
you&#8217;ve come home. I haven&#8217;t known what
to do with all these people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what does it all mean, Putchy?&rdquo; I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
inquired. &ldquo;What are they doing here at
all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, sir!&rdquo; said Mrs. Putchy,
&ldquo;Mr. Doctor-in-Law found that A. Fish, Esq.,
was attracting a good deal of attention out of
doors, and he thought that it would be a
capital idea to have a kind of show here and
charge sixpence admission to see him; and
if there&#8217;s been one, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s been a
hundred people up here this afternoon. The
remarks they&#8217;ve been making too, and the
questions they&#8217;ve been asking. Why, one old
lady, sir, wanted to know how much you paid
A. Fish, Esq., a week, and if I was <em>quite</em> sure
that you gave him enough to eat. They&#8217;ve
broken three chairs too, and that little Venetian
glass vase that stood on the bracket in the
corner. And just now I caught some little
boys tearing pictures out of one of those illustrated
books you brought home last week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here was a pretty state of affairs. The
strangers had by this time left A. Fish, Esq.,
and had collected around the poor Wallypug,
who had been waiting in his wet clothing in
the hall, and I was obliged to politely but
firmly insist upon them at once leaving the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
house, telling them that their money would
be returned at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think so, indeed,&rdquo; said one angry-looking
stout lady. &ldquo;Why, the whole thing
is a fraud and you ought to be thoroughly
ashamed of yourself. Talking fish indeed! I
don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s a fish at all&mdash;at any rate,
not what I call a &lsquo;fish,&rsquo;&rdquo; and she flounced
down the stairs only to return a moment or
two afterwards to say, &ldquo;I thought you said
that we were to have our money back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are, madam,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&#8217;t you see that we get it
then? That man downstairs refuses to give
me any money. The whole thing is a swindle.
But I don&#8217;t mean to be defrauded in this way,
I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went downstairs and told the Doctor-in-Law
that he must at once return everyone
their money, and this after a great deal of
grumbling he did, while the Commissionaire
and the page boy tore down the posters outside
the door at my request.</p>

<p>I explained to the Doctor-in-Law that this
sort of thing must not occur again, and made
him promise that he would never again use
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
my rooms as a place in which to hold a
show.</p>

<p>I really felt rather annoyed about it, for I
could not imagine whatever the neighbours
would think of me for permitting such a scene
to take place in my rooms, but it evidently
was useless now to say anything more about
it.</p>

<p>The next morning, despite the wetting which
the Wallypug had received at the Round Pond,
his thoughts still ran upon boating, and nothing
would satisfy his Majesty but that he should
go for a row. I suggested Richmond as the
best place to start from, and so we drove
over Hammersmith Bridge and across Barnes
Common.</p>

<p>Arrived at Richmond we had no difficulty
in securing a nice boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ll row for one,&rdquo; said his Majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I for another,&rdquo; said the Rhymester.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Perhaps the
Doctor-in-Law will steer, and so we will
manage very nicely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite a large crowd had collected to see us
start, and perhaps that is what made the
Wallypug so nervous; as it was, as soon as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
we pushed off, his Majesty fell backwards
with his feet sticking up above the seat,
while the Rhymester stuck one oar deep
down into the water and pulled it with all
his might, while the other flourished about in
the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 516px;">
<img src="images/img016.png" width="516" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">his majesty fell backwards</span>
</div>

<p>The Doctor-in-Law&#8217;s idea of steering consisted
in pulling first one string and then the
other, and so we did not get along very well
just at first.</p>

<p>When the Wallypug had picked himself up
from the bottom of the boat, however, and the
Rhymester and he made another attempt, I
think we should have got along fairly well if
the Doctor-in-Law, in trying to get out of
the way of a passing boat, had not steered us
into the bank, where we stuck fast in the
mud till someone on the footpath very kindly
pushed us off again. After that I thought it
best to take the oars myself, and his Majesty
steered under my direction. In this way we
managed to get a little way past Teddington
Lock by luncheon time, and having found an
<em>eyot</em> with no one on it we went ashore and
unpacked the hamper of good things which
we had brought with us.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
It was a beautiful day, and I think that we
all enjoyed the picnic immensely. I know
that I did for one, and so, I think, did his
Majesty, for after the meal he laid aside his
crown and royal robes and made himself comfortable
on the grass under the trees, and
looked thoroughly happy with a big cigar in
his mouth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/img017.png" width="300" height="171" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">his majesty enjoys himself</span>
</div>

<p>A. Fish, Esq., busied himself in preparing
notes for his lecture on the &ldquo;Perhapness of
the Improbable,&rdquo; and the Doctor-in-Law, having
piled all the cushions in the boat at one end,
threw himself upon them and read the newspaper.</p>

<p>In this way the afternoon passed very comfortably,
and the Rhymester, after scribbling
upon several pieces of paper, came and read
to me a poem which had been inspired by
our beautiful surroundings; he called it</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
SOUL YEARNINGS.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
The water&#8217;s as wet as wet can be,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the trees, and the grass, are green,</span><br />
While the little birds sing and the fishes swim;<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8217;Tis a most delightful scene.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
It makes me yearn for I don&#8217;t know what,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To come from I don&#8217;t know where,</span><br />

  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the what-you-may-call-&#8217;ems there;</span></p>

<p>and he told me that beautiful scenery always
affected him in that way.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img018.png" width="250" height="241" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">an unfortunate volley</span>
</div>

<p>It was now time for us to be thinking
about getting back, especially as I should
have to do all of the
rowing. So we got
into the boat again,
and I rowed back as
far as Twickenham,
where we stopped at
Eel-pie Island to have
some tea. While we
were waiting for it to
be prepared, we began a game of tennis,
but were obliged to leave off, as an unfortunate
volley of the Doctor-in-Law&#8217;s caught the
Wallypug on the nose, and so his Majesty
declined to play any more.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
We persuaded him to join us at cricket,
though, having found some stumps and a bat
and ball in an outhouse on the Island, and
got on very well for
some time till, at a
shout of &ldquo;out, leg
before wicket,&rdquo; the
Wallypug (who had
caught the ball very
nicely on his shin) fell
forward on to the
Doctor-in-Law, crushing his hat well over his
eyes, and ruffling his temper considerably.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img019.png" width="250" height="199" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;out&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>In fact, I was very glad that tea was
announced just then, for I feared that there
was going to be a bother, and, as it was, the
Doctor-in-Law kept scowling at his Majesty
very fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall make him pay for it,&rdquo; declared the
little man, and, during tea, which we had at
wicker tables by the river&#8217;s edge, he was busy
making out an account, which later he handed
with great solemnity to the Wallypug. His
Majesty apparently could not understand it,
and passed it on to me. On examination, I
found it to be worded as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

                                 <span style="margin-left: 14.5em;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by moral deterioration?&rdquo;
demanded the Wallypug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&#8217;t know. Same as other people
do, I suppose,&rdquo; said the Doctor-in-Law. &ldquo;It&#8217;s
always charged now, I believe. I read something
about it in the papers this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the addition is all wrong,&rdquo; I expostulated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&#8217;t,&rdquo; replied the Doctor-in-Law,
rudely snatching the document from me and
putting it into his pocket-book, &ldquo;and if it is,
it&#8217;s nothing to do with you. I shall charge
it in our expenses, which the people of Why
have undertaken to pay, so there.&rdquo; And the
avaricious little fellow ran off to the boat,
which we afterwards found he had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
letting out on hire to small boys at a penny
a head.</p>

<p>The return journey was accomplished without
any remarkable incidents, and on reaching
home I found a very pressing invitation from
Girlie&#8217;s mother for the whole party to attend
her &ldquo;At Home&rdquo; the next day.</p>

<p>It appears that this lady had called upon
me while we were out, and Mrs. Putchy had
told her of the Wallypug&#8217;s arrival.</p>

<p>His Majesty was good enough to say that
he should be delighted to accept, and so I
wrote off at once to say that she might expect
us.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>LOST</strong></p>


<p>We had a terrible fright the next morning,
for the poor dear Wallypug got
lost, and for some time we could not imagine
what had become of him.</p>

<p>It happened in this way: directly after breakfast
his Majesty said that he should like to
go for a walk and look at the shops.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m not going,&rdquo; declared the Doctor-in-Law.
&ldquo;I have some <em>very</em> important letters to
write.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We all looked up in surprise, for we did
not know that the Doctor-in-Law had any
other acquaintances in London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Letters from which I hope to derive a
princely income,&rdquo; continued the little man
grandly; &ldquo;and, therefore, I have no time for
such foolishness as looking into shop windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
&ldquo;He&#8217;s afraid thad he bight have to sped
sub buddy,&rdquo; remarked A. Fish, Esq.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; replied the Doctor-in-Law,
turning very red though.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, don&#8217;t waste time talking about it;
let&#8217;s go if we are going,&rdquo; said the Rhymester;
and so, as I also had some correspondence to
attend to, it was arranged that the Wallypug,
the Rhymester, and A. Fish, Esq., should go
for a little stroll by themselves. I had some
doubts in my own mind as to the advisability
of letting them go alone, but they promised
not to go beyond Kensington Gardens, and
to wait for me there just inside the gates.</p>

<p>After they had gone I settled down to my
letter-writing, and was getting along nicely
when the Doctor-in-Law interrupted me with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, I wish you would let me have about
twenty sheets of note-paper, will you, please?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty!&rdquo; I exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, twenty,&rdquo; said the Doctor-in-Law.
&ldquo;Or you had better make it a quire while
you are about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought the quickest way to get rid of
him was to give him the paper, so I got up
and got it for him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
&ldquo;And a packet of envelopes, please,&rdquo; he
said, as I handed it to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; I asked rather sarcastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stamps!&rdquo; he replied, calmly holding out
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, really&mdash;&rdquo; I expostulated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, halfpenny ones will do. You&#8217;re surely
not so mean as to mind tenpence, are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m mean, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hand them over then, and don&#8217;t waste so
much time talking,&rdquo; said the little man impatiently,
and so, just to get rid of him, I
gave him the stamps and sat down to my
letters again.</p>

<p>I had hardly begun when he came back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t you take any other newspapers
than these?&rdquo; he demanded, showing me a
handful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&#8217;t, and I think it&#8217;s rather extravagant
of me to have those,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, how do you suppose that I
am going to manage? I want at least five
other papers, and it&#8217;s <em>most</em> important that I
should have them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might buy them,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
&ldquo;They are so dear,&rdquo; he grumbled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&#8217;t you go to the Public
Library then?&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;You know
where it is, and you could see all of the papers
there, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, a capital idea,&rdquo; he said, putting on
his hat and going out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;I shall have peace at
last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was not left undisturbed long though, for
a few minutes later Mrs. Putchy came to the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, sir, will you go down? Mr.
Doctor-in-Law is having such a bother with
the postman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hurried out, and found the little man very
angry indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This postman won&#8217;t give me a letter,&rdquo; he
cried when he saw me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he hasn&#8217;t one for you,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I saw him giving them away all down
the street for nothing,&rdquo; persisted the Doctor-in-Law.
&ldquo;And when I asked him in a civil
way for one, he refused to give it to me. It&#8217;s
no use for him to say he hasn&#8217;t one, when he
has a whole packet in his hand now, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
lot more in his bag, no doubt. Are you going
to give me a letter or not?&rdquo; he continued,
turning to the postman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/img020.png" width="337" height="400" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;are you going to give me a letter or not?&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; continued the man, smiling. &ldquo;I
haven&#8217;t any for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; said the Doctor-in-Law
decidedly, &ldquo;I shall certainly write to the Queen
and tell her that if she employs you any longer
I shall take all my custom away, and I shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
not send the twenty letters, that I intended
writing to-day, off at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I endeavoured to explain to the little man
that the postman could not possibly give him
a letter if he had not one addressed to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&#8217;s all nonsense,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
going off in a huff. &ldquo;Of course you would
take his part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before I could settle down to work again
the Rhymester and A. Fish, Esq., returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&#8217;s the Wallypug?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&#8217;s coming by the next &#8217;bus,&rdquo; said
the Rhymester. &ldquo;Haven&#8217;t you had any rain
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we had quidt a sharb shower,&rdquo; said
A. Fish, Esq., &ldquo;ad I was afraid of gettig
wet, so we stopped a &#8217;bus&mdash;there was odly
roob for two though, ad the Wallypug said
thad he would cub od by the dext.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he will get home all right,&rdquo; I said
anxiously. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t think you ought to have
left his Majesty by himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&#8217;s only a little way,&rdquo; said the
Rhymester; &ldquo;he&#8217;s sure to get home all right.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 546px;">
<img src="images/img021.png" width="546" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;so we stopped a &#8217;bus&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>An hour passed and there was no signs of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the Wallypug. I now began to get seriously
anxious.</p>

<p>It would, of course, be the easiest thing in
the world for his Majesty to take the wrong
&#8217;bus, and be taken goodness knows where.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t think what was best to be done.
The Rhymester suggested sending the Crier
out, but I never remembered having seen one
at Kensington, and at last, after searching for
some time ourselves in Kensington Gardens,
and making inquiries in High Street, and failing
to glean any tidings of his Majesty, I
thought it best to go to the Police Station.</p>

<p>Here I found a very important-looking
official in uniform, with a big book in front
of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he inquired, glaring at me
fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;ve called to know if you could assist me
in finding a friend who, I fear, has lost his
way,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>The official did not answer me, but reached
down another large book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s his name?&rdquo; he inquired gruffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name? Oh&mdash;er&mdash;his name is&mdash;er&mdash;that
is to say he is the&mdash;&rdquo; I had not the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
least idea what the Wallypug&#8217;s name really
was, so I couldn&#8217;t very well say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s his name?&rdquo; shouted the official.
&ldquo;I&#8217;ll ask you what he <em>is</em> presently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;m very sorry, but I really do not
know his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man glanced at me very suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said he was a friend of yours&mdash;it&#8217;s
a very odd thing that you don&#8217;t know his
name. What is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&#8217;s a&mdash;a&mdash;Wallypug,&rdquo; I stammered.
&ldquo;That is to say he&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wallypug!&rdquo; exclaimed the man contemptuously.
&ldquo;What&#8217;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&#8217;s a kind of king, you know,&rdquo; I
explained, feeling that the explanation was
rather a lame one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A <em>kind</em> of king!&rdquo; exclaimed the police
officer. &ldquo;Explain yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t explain more
clearly than that,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;This gentleman
has been staying with me for a couple
of days, and went out this morning and lost
his way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did he come from?&rdquo; asked the
man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Because I want to know,&rdquo; he
shouted. &ldquo;Don&#8217;t let me have any further
prevarication. Where did the man, or Wallypug,
or whatever you call him, come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Why. From a place called Why,
you know,&rdquo; I repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>don&#8217;t</em> know,&rdquo; said the officer. &ldquo;I&#8217;ve
never heard of such a place. Where is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&#8217;m very sorry, but
I cannot tell you. I don&#8217;t know myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is <em>very</em> remarkable,&rdquo; said the man,
glaring at me through his glasses. &ldquo;You
don&#8217;t know your friend&#8217;s name; you call him
a Wallypug, and can&#8217;t explain what that is,
you don&#8217;t know where he comes from&mdash;perhaps
you can tell me how he reached your
house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was now really in a fix, for how could I
tell this man that his Majesty had stepped
out of a picture.</p>

<p>I thought the best thing to do was to hold
my tongue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did he come?&rdquo; repeated the officer.
&ldquo;By train?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
&ldquo;By steamer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I shook my head again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he drive?&mdash;or come on a bicycle, or
walk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remained silent.</p>

<p>The police officer stared at me for a moment
or two, waiting for my answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, young man,&rdquo; said he at last,
evidently very angry indeed. &ldquo;It strikes me
that you are having a game with me. You
had better go away quietly or I shall be obliged
to take you in charge as a lunatic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I assure you that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was your friend dressed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he wore a somewhat battered gold
crown, and carried an orb and sceptre, and
was dressed in knee breeches and a velvet
cloak with an ermine collar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man gave me a keen glance and then
rang a bell. A policeman appeared a moment
or two afterwards, and the officer whispered
something to him, of which I only caught the
words, &ldquo;harmless lunatic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lunatic, sir; yes, sir. Step this way,
please,&rdquo; said the policeman, and before I could
realize what had happened I was bundled into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
a small bare room, and the key was turned in
the lock and I was a prisoner.</p>

<p>Here was a pretty state of affairs. The
stupid people had mistaken me for a lunatic,
and I was no doubt to be locked up here
till a doctor arrived.</p>

<p>Of course the only thing for me to do was
to sit still and wait as patiently as I could.
Fortunately the police people thought of telegraphing
to the other stations to find out if
anything was known of an escaped lunatic;
and from Fulham came the reply, &ldquo;We have
found one ourselves. He calls himself a Wallypug,
and is dressed like a second-hand king.&rdquo;
This caused inquiries to be made, and eventually
I was taken in a cab to Fulham, where
we found his Majesty in the charge of the
police, he having been found wandering about
the Fulham Road quite unable to give what
they considered a satisfactory account of himself.</p>

<p>It was most unfortunate that his Majesty
should have taken the wrong &#8217;bus, for, not having
any money with him, he was set down in a
totally strange neighbourhood, and had quite
forgotten my address. Of course, now that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
we had been brought face to face, we had no
difficulty in convincing the police people that
we were what we represented ourselves to be,
and were soon, to our great relief, on our way
home again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think that I should like to be a
policeman,&rdquo; remarked the Wallypug, on our
way there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have to catch dogs for a living?&rdquo;
remarked his Majesty solemnly. &ldquo;There were
several brought in while I was waiting, and
the policeman who had caught them seemed
so pleased about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I explained to the Wallypug as well as I
was able about the muzzling order, and his
Majesty was highly indignant, and when I
pointed out several dogs with muzzles on he
was more indignant still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are they always obliged to wear those
horrible wire cages over their heads?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>I told his Majesty that in London the order
for wearing them had been in force for some
considerable time, and we had a long talk over
the matter, his Majesty declaring that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
should try and invent a new muzzle which
should be more comfortable for the poor dogs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/img022.png" width="448" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">unable to give an account of himself</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, here we are at last,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as
we turned the corner near my house. &ldquo;And
there are the others on the steps!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are! Here they are!&rdquo; shouted
the Rhymester to the others, and everyone
rushed forward to assist his Majesty to alight,
seemingly very glad to see us back again.</p>

<p>We were quite as delighted to get back, I
can tell you, and I was so relieved at having
found the Wallypug that I hadn&#8217;t the heart
to refuse the Doctor-in-Law&#8217;s request that I
would give him ten shillings worth of penny
stamps to put into the letters which he had
been writing while we had been away, although
he would not give me the slightest clue as to
what they were wanted for.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>AN &lsquo;AT HOME&rsquo; AND THE ACADEMY</strong></p>


<p>We were quite ready for luncheon, as you
may imagine, after our morning&#8217;s adventures,
and directly afterwards his Majesty
set to work on the new dog&#8217;s muzzle which
he had promised to invent. In about half an
hour he had constructed one with which he
was intensely delighted, and he persuaded A.
Fish, Esq., to try it on that we might see
the effect.</p>

<p>It certainly was very simple, but as there
was nothing whatever to go over the mouth,
I felt sure that it could not possibly be very
useful. I did not like to tell his Majesty so
though, for he seemed so thoroughly proud
of his achievement.</p>

<p>It was now time to go to the &lsquo;At Home,&rsquo;
so, wishing to do honour to the occasion, our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
&lsquo;State Coach,&rsquo; as we called it, was sent for,
and we drove off in fine style.</p>

<p>There were a great many people invited to
meet us, and I could see that there was quite
a little flutter of excitement when the Wallypug
entered.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/img023.png" width="296" height="350" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">it certainly was very simple</span>
</div>

<p>His Majesty, however, in his simple, good-natured
way soon put everybody at their
ease, and laughed and chattered with the
utmost affability.</p>

<p>Girlie and Boy had both been allowed to
come into the drawing-room, and Girlie quite
claimed the Wallypug as her own particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
guest, while Boy renewed his acquaintance
with the Rhymester, whom he had met before
at Zum, and despite their mother&#8217;s protests
they carried these two members of our party
off in triumph to show them their play-room
and toys and to talk over old times.</p>

<p>While they were away the Doctor-in-Law
made himself very agreeable to the ladies,
and I watched him bowing and smiling and
chatting, first with one group, then with
another, with great amusement. I found out
afterwards that he had promised several of
them portraits of his Majesty and suite for
2s. 6d. each as soon as they should be taken,
and in every case had asked for the money
in advance; but the great event of the afternoon
was when A. Fish, Esq., wrapped up
in Mrs. Putchy&#8217;s pink woollen shawl, borrowed
for the occasion, and surrounded by a group
of young ladies, consented after much pressing
to deliver part of his lecture on the &ldquo;Perhapness
of the Improbable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bust sed for the Rhymebster though
to help be to read id, for by cold is still so
bad thad I can&#8217;d do id by byself,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img024.png" width="400" height="380" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">a. fish, esq., obliges</span>
</div>

<p>So the Rhymester was sent for, and his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Majesty also came down to hear the wonderful
lecture. It had been turned into verse by the
Rhymester, who, after an affected attempt to
clear his throat, read as follows:</p>

<p class="center">THE PERHAPNESS OF THE IMPROBABLE.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
If <em>this</em> were that, and <em>these</em> were those,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <em>hither</em> nearer thither,</span><br />
Why, <em>which</em> might be whate&#8217;er it chose,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <em>there</em> be any whither.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
Somehow &#8217;twould be the simpler way<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To <em>dearer</em> be than cheaper,</span><br />
And that&#8217;s why <em>when</em> (each other day)<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would <em>higher</em> be than <em>deeper</em>.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 11em;">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
So <em>worst</em> would be the <em>best</em> of all,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And <em>far more less</em> than either;</span><br />
While <em>short</em> would certainly be <em>tall</em>,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And therefore thus be neither.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful! charming!&rdquo; echoed all the young
ladies at once when he had finished, while one
lady sitting near me exclaimed, &ldquo;How sweetly
simple!&rdquo; For my own part I thought that it
was anything but simple, and caught myself
trying to follow the line of argument with the
most brain-confusing results.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 353px;">
<img src="images/img025.png" width="353" height="400" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">absent-mindedly spilt his tea</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
The Wallypug was greatly distressed when
he discovered that while listening to the reading,
and looking at the charming young lady
with whom he had been conversing, he had
absent-mindedly spilt the whole of his cup of
tea over her dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, they didn&#8217;t give me a plate
to put my cake on,&rdquo; I heard him explain
apologetically, &ldquo;and it <em>was</em> so awkward, for
my cup would keep slipping about on the
saucer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young lady smiled very sweetly and
assured his Majesty that it didn&#8217;t matter in
the least, and shortly afterwards we left, having
stayed, as it was, far beyond the regulation time.</p>

<p>When we arrived home we found a letter
addressed to the Rhymester in the letter-box,
which in a state of great excitement he tore
open with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>Upon reading the contents he burst into
tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor man, poor man!&rdquo; he sobbed. &ldquo;I
am so sorry to have caused him so much
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a letter from an Editor,&rdquo; he explained
through his tears, &ldquo;and he is in great distress
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
through not being able to publish my poem.
He says he greatly regrets his inability to
make use of it! Poor man, he evidently feels
it very keenly. I must write and tell him not
to be too unhappy about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had some letters to write too, one to a
photographer in Regent Street, asking for an
appointment the next morning, for I was determined
that the Doctor-in-Law should send
the promised photographs to the young ladies
without delay.</p>

<p>The first thing in the morning came a
telegram to say that we could be photographed
at eleven o&#8217;clock, so, after my guests had made
themselves as spruce as possible, we started
off and reached there in good time.</p>

<p>It was suggested that the Wallypug should
be taken by himself, but when he saw the
camera pointed directly at him while the
operator disappeared beneath the black cloth,
he came to the conclusion that it was too
dangerous a machine to be faced with impunity,
so he suddenly turned his back upon it, and
nervously fled from the room.</p>

<p>It was only by promising that the others
should be taken with him that we could get
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
him to sit at all, and even then there was a
strained and nervous expression upon his face,
which suggested that he was in momentary fear
that the thing would &ldquo;go off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rhymester insisted upon being taken
with one of his poems in his hand, the Doctor-in-Law
wore his usual complacent smile, and
altogether the group was quite a success.</p>

<p>As soon as the &ldquo;operation,&rdquo; as the Wallypug
would insist upon calling it, was over, we went
downstairs, his Majesty leading the way, while
the Doctor-in-Law stayed behind for a moment
to make some arrangements with the photographer
about commission. We had intended
going home by &#8217;bus, but when we got to the
door his Majesty was nowhere to be seen.
What could have become of him? We looked
up and down the street, but could see no signs
of him anywhere; and at last, after hunting
about for a considerable time, he was discovered
calmly sitting inside a furniture removal van,
waiting for it to start, under the impression
that it was an omnibus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&#8217;m sure this is the right one,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;for it has &lsquo;Kensington&rsquo; printed in large letters
on it. Come along, there&#8217;s plenty of room
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
inside; the conductor and the driver will be
here presently, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I laughingly explained to his Majesty the
mistake which he had made, and we walked
on as far as Piccadilly Circus, where we found
a &#8217;bus to take us to the Academy, which we
intended visiting on our way home. We had
not gone far though, when I suddenly remembered
that the 22nd June was very close
at hand, and that I had better make arrangements
for seats to view the Jubilee Procession
or I should be too late. So it was arranged
that the Doctor-in-Law should take charge of
the party while I went on to the agents to
see about the seats. They would have no
difficulty in getting home by themselves for
the &#8217;buses ran from just outside the Academy
doors straight to Kensington, so I felt sure
that they would be all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much is the entrance fee to the
Academy?&rdquo; asked the Doctor-in-Law, as I
was getting down from the &#8217;bus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shilling each,&rdquo; I replied, and I saw the
little man collecting the money from the others
as the &#8217;bus disappeared from view.</p>

<p>I was very fortunate at the agents in being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
able to secure a capital window in Piccadilly,
and some Stores in the neighbourhood undertook
to provide a luncheon and to suitably
decorate the window for us.</p>

<p>These arrangements being satisfactorily concluded,
I hurried home, and was greatly relieved
to find my guests there before me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you enjoy the Academy?&rdquo; I
inquired.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/img027.png" width="340" height="350" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">could not understand the catalogue</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; said his Majesty decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waste of money, I call it,&rdquo; said the
Rhymester, sniffing contemptuously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
&ldquo;I was dever so disappointed id edythig id
all by life!&rdquo; declared A. Fish, Esq.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides, the catalogue was no good at all,&rdquo;
complained his Majesty. &ldquo;We could make
neither head nor tail of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor-in-Law was silent, and it was
only by very careful inquiry that I found out
that, after pocketing their money, he had taken
them to an immense hoarding covered with
advertisement posters, and had gammoned them
into believing that <em>that</em> was the Academy, while
it was no wonder that the poor Wallypug could
not understand the &lsquo;catalogue,&rsquo; for it was nothing
more nor less than an old illustrated stores
price list.</p>

<p>It was really too bad of the Doctor-in-Law.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE JUBILEE</strong></p>


<p>The few days which elapsed before the
memorable 22nd of June passed very
quickly, and we were all more or less busy
making preparations for the festival. His
Majesty would insist upon polishing up his
regalia himself in order to do honour to the
occasion, and spent hours over his crown with
a piece of chamois leather and some whitening
till, though somewhat battered by the
rough usage it had sustained, it shone quite
brilliantly. Mrs. Putchy herself suggested
making his Majesty some new red silk rosettes
for his shoes, which he very graciously consented
to accept. The Doctor-in-Law was
always so spick and span that we scarcely
noticed any change in his appearance, but
the Rhymester had made arrangements with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
General Mary Jane to wash, starch, and iron
his lace collar, and he remained in his room
one entire day while it was being done up.
A. Fish, Esq., purchased a necktie of most
brilliant colouring, and One-and-Nine touched
himself up here and there with some red
enamel where his tunic had
become shabby in places, so
that altogether our party
looked very smart as we
drove at a very early hour to
our seats in Piccadilly. To
avoid the crowd we went by
way of Bayswater Road, and
then passed down Park Lane
and through Berkeley Square,
in order to reach the back
entrance to the house in Piccadilly where I
had booked seats. Our gorgeous carriage was
everywhere hailed with great delight, being of
course mistaken for a portion of the Jubilee procession,
and many were the conjectures heard
on all sides as to who the Wallypug could
possibly be.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 167px;">
<img src="images/img028.png" width="167" height="300" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">with some red enamel</span>
</div>

<p>Our window was in the centre of the building
on the first floor, and we had it all to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
ourselves. A table at the back of the room
was tastefully set out with an excellent cold
collation, and in front of the window, which
was most elaborately decorated with velvet
curtains, flags, and trophies, and which was
surmounted by a device which was understood
to be the Wallypug&#8217;s coat-of-arms, a gorgeous,
gilded, high-backed chair was placed as a throne
for his Majesty, and comfortable seats were
also provided for the rest of the party.</p>

<p>The crowd outside greeted our appearance
with quite a demonstration, as by the enormous
placard outside announcing the name of the
decorators, and stating that they were by
appointment to his Majesty the Wallypug of
Why, of course everybody knew who we were.
Indeed, one learned-looking person in the crowd
was holding forth to an eager audience, and
explaining exactly where Why was situated,
and pretending that he had been there, and
had seen the Wallypug before, ever so many
times.</p>

<p>As the time approached for the procession
to pass, the Wallypug became very excited
and nervous. &ldquo;Shall I really see the Queen
of England?&rdquo; he kept asking over and over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
again. &ldquo;Do you think she will see me? Will
she bow to me? What must I say? Must I
keep my crown on or take it off?&rdquo; and innumerable
other questions of the same nature.</p>

<p>Presently the excitement and enthusiasm
reached their height, as amid a confused shouting
of &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; the Guards in advance
came in sight. Slowly the mighty procession,
with its innumerable squadrons and bands
passed, and at last, after the English and
Foreign princes and Eastern potentates, the
eight cream-coloured Hanoverian horses, drawing
the Jubilee landau, made their appearance,
and the Queen was seen, smiling and bowing
graciously to the cheering populace. The
Doctor-in-Law, in his excitement, scrambled
on to the window ledge in order to obtain a
better view; the Wallypug loyally waved his
crown; while the Rhymester, hurriedly unrolling
a lengthy ode which he had written
especially for the occasion, began reading it
in a loud voice, and, though nobody paid the
slightest attention to him, did not desist until
long after the procession had passed.</p>

<span class="caption">the wallypug loyally waved his crown</span>
</div>

<p>The Wallypug was very thoughtful for some
time after the Queen had gone by, and, during
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the drive home, expressed his great surprise
that her Majesty had not worn a crown,
and apparently could not understand why it
should not be worn on all occasions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose her Majesty has a crown of her
own, hasn&#8217;t she?&rdquo; he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course!&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it then?&rdquo; persisted his Majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe all of the regalia is kept carefully
locked up and guarded in the Tower of
London,&rdquo; I said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think it&#8217;s very unkind of them
not to let her Majesty have them out on an
occasion like this. I shall see what I can do
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dear Wallypug&#8217;s intentions were evidently
so good that I did not say anything
in reply to this, though I wondered to myself
whatever his Majesty thought that <em>he</em> could do
in the matter.</p>

<p>There were so many people about that we
considered it best to spend the rest of the day
quietly at home, though we did venture out
in the evening to see the illuminations, which
delighted his Majesty exceedingly.</p>

<p>The next afternoon the whole party, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the exception of One-and-Nine, drove over the
route taken by the procession, in order to see
the street decorations. I remained at home,
and late in the afternoon there was a knock
at my door, and General Mary Jane entered.
She was nervously wringing a handkerchief
wet with tears, and her eyes were quite red
with weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; she began, sniffing pathetically,
&ldquo;I want to gi&mdash;gi&mdash;give no&mdash;notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! what ever for?&rdquo; I asked in surprise,
for General Mary Jane was an excellent
servant, and Mrs. Putchy had always been
very pleased with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, sir, it&#8217;s Sergeant One-and-Nine;
he&#8217;s broken my &#8217;art, sir, and I can&#8217;t bear it
no longer,&rdquo; and the poor girl burst into a
flood of tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;whatever do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, you see ever since he&#8217;s been
&#8217;ere, sir, he&#8217;s been a making hup to me;
leastwise that&#8217;s what I thought he meant,
sir; but this afternoon bein&#8217; my day hout, I
went up to Kensington Gardens for a walk
(him a saying as he would be there), and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
what should I see when I gets there, but him
a walkin&#8217; about with half-a-dozen of them
nursemaids in white frocks a followin&#8217; of him.
Not that I says as it&#8217;s altogether his fault;
they will run after the military; but it&#8217;s more
than I can stand, sir, me bein&#8217; that proud at
&#8217;avin&#8217; a soldier for a sweetheart, and all,&rdquo; and
she began to cry again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img030.png" width="400" height="364" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">they will run after the military</span>
</div>

<p>I hardly knew what to do, but suggested
that she should not think too seriously about it,
and General Mary Jane, saying she hoped I
would excuse her troubling me in the matter,
decided to go to her married sister at Barnes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and spend the rest of her day out there, and
talk the matter over with her. I had a lot of
writing to do all the afternoon, and the time
passed so quickly that until the gong sounded
for dinner I did not realize that the Wallypug
and his party had not returned. It was now
past seven, and they should have been home
hours since.</p>

<p>I was so anxious about them that I could
scarcely eat any dinner, and as soon as the
meal was over I hurried to the livery stables
to hear if they knew anything about the
matter.</p>

<p>The first person I encountered when I arrived
there was the coachman, now divested of his
fine livery, and busy in the yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bless you, sir, yes, back hours ago,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;I set his Majesty and the others down
at your door about five o&#8217;clock, and I did
hear them say something about going down
to Hammersmith for a walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Hammersmith?&rdquo; I echoed in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;they wanted to see the Suspension
Bridge and the river again, so I
told them the way to get there. They&#8217;re
all right, sir, I&#8217;ll be bound. The Doctor-in-Law
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
is too wide awake for anything to happen
to them while he is with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I walked home somewhat easier in my mind
now that I knew the party had returned safely,
though still somewhat anxious as to their
whereabouts.</p>

<p>About nine o&#8217;clock it began to get quite
dark, and I was just setting out to see if I
could find any trace of them when General
Mary Jane returned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 437px;">
<img src="images/img031.png" width="437" height="300" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;and donkey rides&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; she exclaimed directly she saw
me, &ldquo;what do you think? His Majesty and
the Doctor-in-Law and the others are down
at the fair by Hammersmith Bridge, and they
are &#8217;aving such a lark. I see them all &#8217;aving
a roundabout as I was coming past on my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
way &#8217;ome from my sister&#8217;s just now; such a
crowd there was a cheering and a hollering.
Cocoa-nut shies, too, a boy told me they had
been &#8217;aving, and old Aunt Sally, and donkey
rides along the towing path.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img032.png" width="450" height="263" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;they are &#8217;aving such a lark&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>I hurriedly put on my hat and rushed off
to Hammersmith, for I didn&#8217;t know what might
happen to my guests among the rough crowd
which I knew usually gathered there.</p>

<p>When I arrived on the scene I found the
whole party on the roundabout, and when they
alighted I learned that the Doctor-in-Law had
arranged with one of the show people to share
the proceeds of exhibiting the Wallypug and
A. Fish, Esq., in separate tents, at 3d. a head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
I met with considerable opposition from the
show people in my endeavours to persuade
my guests to come home, as they had evidently
been a source of considerable profit to them,
though the man with the cocoa-nut shies declared
that the Doctor-in-Law had claimed a
great many more nuts than he was properly
entitled to.</p>

<p>The crowd made quite a demonstration when
we departed in a four-wheeler, and the Rhymester
evidently considered it a compliment that
the contents of so many &ldquo;ladies&#8217; tormentors,&rdquo;
as the little tubes filled with water are called,
were directed at him. Altogether the whole
party had evidently been delighted with their
evening&#8217;s amusement, though, as I explained
to them while we were driving home, it was
highly inconsistent with the dignity of his
Majesty&#8217;s position, and calculated to cause him
to be treated with a certain amount of disrespect.
I could see, however, that all I said
had very little effect on any of the party, and
that they were one and all highly delighted
with their adventure.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>MORE ADVENTURES</strong></p>


<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s the most contraryish place I&#8217;ve ever
seen,&rdquo; declared One-and-Nine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed the Wallypug. &ldquo;There was
no water in the moat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Drawbridge didn&#8217;t draw,&rdquo; echoed the
Rhymester.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ad the beefeaters didn&#8217;t eat beef,&rdquo; chimed
in A. Fish, Esq., while the Doctor-in-Law
declared that for his part he &ldquo;considered the
morning spent there had been entirely wasted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were talking about the Tower of
London, and were telling Girlie and Boy, who
were spending the afternoon with us, all about
their visit there on the previous day.</p>

<p>I was sitting in an adjoining room&mdash;but
the door being open I could hear all that was
said.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
&ldquo;How did you go?&rdquo; asked Boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed the Wallypug, &ldquo;in the
most extraordinary way you can possibly
imagine. We went into a house in High
Street, Kensington, and bought some little
tickets, and then we handed them to a man
at a barrier, who cut a little piece out of each
one as we passed through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To rebebber us by,&rdquo; chimed in A. Fish, Esq.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued the Wallypug; &ldquo;and then
we went down two flights of stairs, and by-and-bye
a lot of little houses on wheels came
rushing into the station, and we got into one
of them and before you could say &lsquo;Jack
Robinson&rsquo; we were rushing through a big black
tunnel under the ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you mean the Underground Railway,&rdquo;
declared Girlie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed his Majesty. &ldquo;And the little
room we sat in had beautiful soft cushions and
a big light in the middle of the roof, and little
texts printed on the wall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Texts!&rdquo; exclaimed both of the children.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Texts,&rdquo; repeated the Wallypug. &ldquo;What
were they? Do you remember?&rdquo; he asked of
the others.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, one was, &lsquo;You are requested not to
put your feet on the cushions,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the
Rhymester.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and &lsquo;To seat five,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Wait
till the train stops&rsquo;&mdash;I remember now,&rdquo; continued
the Wallypug. &ldquo;Well, we kept rushing
through the tunnel till we came to &lsquo;Holman&#8217;s
Mustard,&rsquo; and a lot of people got out, and then
we went on again till we came to &lsquo;Smears&#8217;
Soap.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&#8217;t &lsquo;Smears&#8217; Soap,&rsquo;&rdquo; contradicted the
Doctor-in-Law. &ldquo;It was somebody&#8217;s Ink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there were such a lot of names,&rdquo;
declared the Wallypug, &ldquo;it was impossible to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
really tell which was which. I always took
the name opposite to my window to be the
right one. The funniest part of it all was, we
kept coming to &lsquo;Holman&#8217;s Mustard&rsquo; over and
over again. I can&#8217;t think how on earth the
people know when to get out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, those weren&#8217;t the names of the
stations at all,&rdquo; laughed Boy. &ldquo;They were
advertisements!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, where were the names of the stations
then?&rdquo; demanded his Majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, in big letters on the walls of course,&rdquo;
was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They couldn&#8217;t have been much bigger
than those of &lsquo;Holman&#8217;s Mustard,&rsquo;&rdquo; persisted
the Wallypug somewhat ungrammatically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind about that; get on with your
story,&rdquo; remarked the Doctor-in-Law impatiently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after going through a lot of tunnels
and stopping ever so many times, we got out
at one of the stations and went upstairs into
the light again, and almost opposite the station
we could see a lot of grey stone buildings
with towers and battlements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know! You mean the Tower. We&#8217;ve
been there,&rdquo; interrupted Girlie.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
&ldquo;Did you see the Lions?&rdquo; asked the Wallypug
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lions! No!&rdquo; exclaimed the children.
&ldquo;There weren&#8217;t any; you didn&#8217;t see any, did
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&#8217;t,&rdquo; admitted the Wallypug,
&ldquo;but the Doctor-in-Law told us that there were
some there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I read it in a book,&rdquo; declared the Doctor-in-Law.
&ldquo;But I daresay it was all a pack
of stories, like the rest of the things they said.
Look at the Crown Jewels for instance&mdash;bits
of glass and rubbish. That&#8217;s why they put
them in an iron cage, so you can&#8217;t get at them
to see if they are real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I think they <em>are</em> real,&rdquo; said Boy.
&ldquo;The Guide told us that they were worth
ever so many thousands of pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he may have <em>said</em> so,&rdquo; remarked the
Doctor-in-Law, &ldquo;but I&#8217;ll be bound he wouldn&#8217;t
let you take them away and examine them for
yourself. I asked them to let me have one or
two of the crowns and things to take home
and test, but they positively refused, although
I promised to return them within a week.
They are afraid that we should find out that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
they are only imitations&mdash;that&#8217;s what&#8217;s the
matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There weren&#8217;t any kings or queens executed
either the day we were there,&rdquo; he continued,
grumbling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m very glad that <em>that</em>
fashion has died out,&rdquo; declared his Majesty.
&ldquo;I don&#8217;t mind admitting now that I was rather
nervous about going at all, for fear that I should
have <em>my</em> head chopped off, and I should feel
so very awkward without one, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! You needn&#8217;t have been alarmed,
for there wasn&#8217;t a Lord High Executioner on
the premises, because I asked,&rdquo; declared the
Rhymester.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but do you know,&rdquo; said his Majesty,
&ldquo;I&#8217;ve found out since, that he lives at the
bottom of our street, and mends shoes for a
living&mdash;he does a little executing still on the
sly, for I have seen his bill in the window,
&lsquo;Orders <em>executed</em> with promptness and dispatch.&rsquo;
I asked him one day what class he executed
most, and he said that his connection was
principally amongst the &lsquo;Uppers.&rsquo; He seems
a very kind man though, and not only executes
orders, but heals them too, poor souls! He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
charges 1s. 3d. for healing. His education has
been sorely neglected, I am afraid, however, for
he spells it &lsquo;heeling.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the Armoury at the Tower?&rdquo;
asked Boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there was another instance of
deception,&rdquo; declared the Doctor-in-Law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is an armoury?&rdquo; inquired the
Doctor-in-Law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A place where arms are kept, I suppose,&rdquo;
replied Boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so, and there wasn&#8217;t an arm in the
place except our own,&rdquo; said the Doctor-in-Law
wrathfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they call guns and things arms,&rdquo; said
Boy, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do they?&rdquo; remarked the Doctor-in-Law
sarcastically. &ldquo;Why don&#8217;t they call things
by their proper names then? they might as
well call them legs, or turnips, or paraffin oil&mdash;bah!
I&#8217;ve no patience with such folly!&rdquo;</p>

a leg left to stand up od.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beefeaters, yes!&rdquo; remarked the Rhymester,
&ldquo;and a pretty lot they were. I tried several
of them with a piece that I had brought with
me in a little paper bag, and not one of them
would touch it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame Tussaud&#8217;s was better; we went
there in the afternoon,&rdquo; said his Majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but who was to know which were
wax figures and which were not?&rdquo; asked the
Doctor-in-Law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you made a pretty muddle of it anyhow,&rdquo;
said the Wallypug. &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo;
he went on, &ldquo;the Doctor-in-Law made us all
pay sixpence each towards the catalogue, and
then went around with us explaining the
various groups. He had just finished telling
us that several ladies, who were standing together,
were Henry the Eighth&#8217;s wives, when
they all marched off looking highly indignant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how was I to know?&rdquo; remarked
the Doctor-in-Law pettishly. &ldquo;I&#8217;d never met
a single one of Henry the Eighth&#8217;s wives in
my life, and how was I to recognize them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&#8217;t think they would have binded so

<span class="caption">he could get no answer</span>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Isn&#8217;t it cruel to keep her shut
up in that case,&rdquo; cried the Wallypug. &ldquo;I&#8217;m
sure she&#8217;s alive, for we could see her breathing
quite distinctly. I was so concerned about
it that I asked the Doctor-in-Law to speak
to a policeman who was standing near by
about it. But he could get no answer from
him, and we found out afterwards that he was
only a wax figure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
&ldquo;The best thig of all,&rdquo; remarked A. Fish,
Esq., &ldquo;was whed we all pretended that we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, it&#8217;s very warm!&rdquo; interrupted
the Doctor-in-Law. &ldquo;Let&#8217;s change the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretended that we&mdash;&rdquo; continued A. Fish,
Esq.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;!&rdquo; cried the Doctor-in-Law
in a warning voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact of the matter is,&rdquo; explained the
Rhymester, &ldquo;the Doctor-in-Law got us all to
pretend that we were wax figures ourselves,
and he tied little money boxes in front of us
with the words: &lsquo;Put a penny in the slot and
the figure will move,&rsquo; written on them, and
when anyone put a penny in we all moved
our heads and rolled our eyes about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&#8217;t!&rdquo; said the Wallypug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I know you didn&#8217;t,&rdquo; replied the
Rhymester. &ldquo;And the Doctor-in-Law had to
explain that you were out of order, and that&#8217;s
how we were found out, for the people wanted
their money back and he wouldn&#8217;t give it to
them, so they called the attendant, and we
had to go out as quickly as we could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ad wasn&#8217;t id beade?&rdquo; said A. Fish, Esq.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
&ldquo;There were four shillings ad threepedce id
the boxes, ad the Doctor-id-Law wouldn&#8217;t
give us a penny of id.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I let you pay my fare home. That
amounted to the same thing,&rdquo; replied the little
man.</p>

<p>Just then Mrs. Putchy came in with afternoon
tea, and I joined my guests in the
drawing-room.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>HIS MAJESTY IS INTERVIEWED</strong></p>


<p>The next morning we were all seated
around the breakfast table laughing over
our adventures of the evening before, when
we had visited the Earl&#8217;s Court Exhibition
together. We had been up in the Great
Wheel, and having passed through the pretty
old English village were walking around the
artificial lake listening to the band playing in
their little pavilion on the island in the middle,
when the Doctor-in-Law declared that he heard
a strange trumpeting sound, and asked me
what it could be. I had not heard it and so
could not tell him, and we were just discussing
the matter when the Wallypug clutched wildly
at his crown, and turning around we saw a
huge elephant lifting it gracefully off his head
with its trunk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Directly his Majesty realized what it was,
he gave a wild scream and took to his heels,
as did all the others, with the exception of the
Rhymester, who tripped against a stone and
lay with his head buried in his arms for some
time, kicking and screaming for help.</p>

<p>Of course it was only the tame elephant
that carries the children on its back, but to
the unaccustomed eyes of the Wallypug and
his party it seemed, so they told me afterwards,
some strange and awful monster ready
to devour them.</p>

<p>As I said, we were laughing merrily over
this adventure when the postman arrived, and
the Doctor-in-Law, without asking to be excused
from the table, rushed out to meet him,
and returned a few minutes later with his arms
loaded with a number of little packages and
one rather large box, which had arrived by
Carter Paterson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, what a lot of letters,&rdquo; remarked
his Majesty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Wouldn&#8217;t you like to know what
they are all about, eh?&rdquo; inquired the Doctor-in-Law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should,&rdquo; admitted the Wallypug;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
while the faces of the others all expressed the
same curiosity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<img src="images/img036.png" width="409" height="600" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">a strange and awful monster</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do,&rdquo; said the
Doctor-in-Law. &ldquo;If you&#8217;ll all pay me fourpence
halfpenny each, I will let you open them and
see for yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a little grumbling at this, but
eventually the money changed hands, and,
the breakfast things having been removed,
the little packages were opened with great
eagerness.</p>

<p>Besides a printed circular, each one contained
some little article&mdash;a pencil case, a pen
knife, a comb, a sample tin of knife polish,
a card of revolving collar studs, and so on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; remarked the Doctor-in-Law complacently
as these articles were spread about
the table; &ldquo;I told you that I expected to
derive a princely revenue from my correspondence,
and now I will explain to you how
it is done. I observed a great number of
advertisements in the daily papers, stating that
&lsquo;A handsome income could be earned without
the slightest trouble or inconvenience, and
particulars would be forwarded to any one
sending six stamps and an addressed envelope&rsquo;;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
so I sent off about twenty, and here is the
result. I see by these circulars that I have
only to sell two hundred of these little pencil
cases at half-a-crown each in order to earn
1s. 6d. commission, and for every dozen tins
of knife polish I sell, I shall be paid 1-&frac12;d.,
besides being able to earn 6d. a thousand by
addressing envelopes for one firm, if I supply
my own envelopes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s in the big box?&rdquo; inquired the
Rhymester.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dittig bachede,&rdquo; replied A. Fish, Esq.,
who had been busily engaged in opening it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo; exclaimed the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dittig bachede for dittig socks,&rdquo; repeated
A. Fish, Esq.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, of course!&rdquo; explained the Doctor-in-Law,
&ldquo;a knitting machine. I was persuaded
to buy it on the understanding that I was
to have constant work all the year round, and
be paid so much per pair for knitting socks
with it. It&#8217;s a most interesting and amusing
occupation, and, I&#8217;ll tell you what, I don&#8217;t
mind letting any one of you use the machine
for sixpence an hour, if you find your own
worsted and give me the socks when they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
are finished. There now! nothing could be
fairer than that, could it?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img037.png" width="400" height="377" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">the &ldquo;dittig bachede&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>And positively A. Fish, Esq., was so infatuated
with the charms of the &ldquo;dittig
bachede,&rdquo; as he called it, that he actually
agreed to these terms, and sent out for some
worsted, and commenced &ldquo;dittig&rdquo; with great
enthusiasm. The Doctor-in-Law then set the
Rhymester to work, addressing the envelopes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
on the understanding that he was to share
the sixpence per thousand to be paid for
them. And, having bothered the Wallypug
and myself into buying a pencil-case and a
knife each, in order to get rid of him, he
started off to the kitchen to see if he could
do any business with Mrs. Putchy in the knife-polish
or black-lead line.</p>

<p>His Majesty and myself were just saying
what an extraordinary little man he was, when
he burst in upon us again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard the news?&rdquo; he inquired, his face
beaming with importance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. What is it?&rdquo; inquired the others
eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! wouldn&#8217;t you like to know?&rdquo; exclaimed
the Doctor-in-Law. &ldquo;How much will
you give me for telling you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; asked the
Rhymester dubiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A penny each,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on then, let&#8217;s have it,&rdquo; said the
Rhymester, collecting the pennies from the
others and handing them to the Doctor-in-Law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Queen Anne is dead, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the Dutch have taken Holland&mdash;yah!&rdquo; And
the little man burst out laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I say, that&#8217;s <em>too</em> bad,&rdquo; grumbled the
Wallypug. &ldquo;Isn&#8217;t it now?&rdquo; he cried, appealing
to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;you shouldn&#8217;t
be so silly as to give him money. You ought
to know by this time what to expect from
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but truly,&rdquo; said the Doctor-in-Law,
pulling a serious face, &ldquo;I <em>have</em> got some news,
the other was only my fun. A lady is going
to call on us at eleven, to interview the
Wallypug. I had almost forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lady!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Whoever do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&#8217;s the Duchess of something. I
forget her name,&rdquo; answered the Doctor-in-Law
nonchalantly. &ldquo;She called the other day
while you were out, and explained that she
was a contributor to one of the latest society
magazines, and was anxious to send an illustrated
interview with the Wallypug, to her
paper; so&mdash;a-hem!&mdash;after we had come to
terms, I arranged for her to come to-day and
see him. You had better go and make yourself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
tidy, hadn&#8217;t you?&rdquo; he continued, turning
to the Wallypug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; I interposed, &ldquo;I think you
might have consulted his Majesty first, before
making these arrangements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! do you?&rdquo; said the Doctor-in-Law
rudely. &ldquo;Well, I don&#8217;t see that it&#8217;s any
business of yours, my good sir&mdash;so there!&rdquo;
and he bounced out of the room again, rattling
his sample tins.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven then, and a few minutes
afterwards a beautifully-appointed carriage drew
up to the door, and Mrs. Putchy brought up a
card inscribed:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 318px;">
<img src="images/duchess.jpg" width="318" height="35" alt="Her Grace the Duchess of Mortlake" title="" />
</div>

<p>and immediately ushered in a fashionably-dressed
lady, who smilingly offered me the
tips of her fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, <em>how</em> do you do? You are the gentleman,
I think, who is to introduce me to his
Majesty, are you not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, really, your Grace, we have only just
heard of the appointment, but his Majesty the
Wallypug will be very pleased to receive you
I am sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
&ldquo;And is that his Majesty at the other end
of the room?&rdquo; whispered the Duchess. &ldquo;Pray
present me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I made the necessary introduction, and the
Duchess gave the regulation Court &lsquo;dip,&rsquo; which
the Wallypug gravely imitated, and then in
his usual simple manner offered his hand with
a smile.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/img038.png" width="350" height="280" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">in the most approved fashion</span>
</div>

<p>Her Grace made a deep presentation curtsey
and bowed over it in the most approved
fashion; but the Wallypug, evidently unused
to being treated with so much ceremony, withdrew
it hastily and remarked nervously but
politely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&#8217;t you take a seat, madam?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, &lsquo;Your Grace,&rsquo;&rdquo; I whispered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked his Majesty blankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because this lady is a Duchess, and you
must always say &lsquo;Your Grace&rsquo; when speaking
to her,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said the Wallypug vaguely&mdash;then
going up to the Duchess he solemnly said,
&ldquo;I&#8217;m Grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;You don&#8217;t understand
me. I mean, when you speak to this
lady you must call her &lsquo;Your Grace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, how stupid of me, to be sure!&rdquo;
said his Majesty. &ldquo;I understand now. I beg
your pardon. I meant to say, &lsquo;You are my
Grace,&rsquo; madam,&rdquo; he continued, addressing
himself to the Duchess.</p>

<p>Her Grace amiably laughed away this little
mistake, and was soon busy asking questions.
The Wallypug, however, got very nervous,
and made a shocking lot of mistakes in his
answers. He couldn&#8217;t even say how old he
was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I&#8217;ve been in the family for years,&rdquo;
he remarked, &ldquo;and I fancy I must have come
over with William the Conqueror. Such a lot
of people did that, you know, and it&#8217;s so respectable.
I don&#8217;t remember it, of course;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
but then I&#8217;ve been told that I was born very
young, and so naturally I shouldn&#8217;t do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does your Majesty remember any of the
incidents of your early life?&rdquo; asked the
Duchess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was considered remarkably bald for my
age as an infant,&rdquo; replied the Wallypug simply.
&ldquo;And I believe I had several measles, and a
mump or two as a child. But I don&#8217;t wish to
boast about them,&rdquo; he added modestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you educated, your Majesty?&rdquo;
was the next question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&#8217;t,&rdquo; replied the Wallypug with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does your Majesty mean that you received
no education at all?&rdquo; asked the Duchess in
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I was taught reading, and writing,
and arithmetic, and the use of the globes, and
Latin and Greek, and all that rubbish, of
course,&rdquo; replied the Wallypug. &ldquo;But I mean
there were no Universities at Why, where I
could receive a higher education, and be taught
cricket, and football, and rowing, and all those
classical things taught at Oxford and Cambridge,
you know. I was considered the best
boy in my form at marbles though,&rdquo; he added
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
proudly. &ldquo;And I could beat any of the
masters at Hop Scotch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your favourite diet, your Majesty?&rdquo;
came next.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! jumbles, I think&mdash;or bull&#8217;s eyes. I&#8217;m
very fond of hardbake too, and I love cocoa-nut
ice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few more questions such as these, and
her Grace took her departure, after taking
several snap-shot photographs of various articles
in the drawing room.</p>

<p>I felt convinced that with such a scanty
amount of information at her disposal the
Duchess would have great difficulty in writing
an article on the Wallypug, and was therefore
the more surprised a few days later to receive
a copy of the magazine which her Grace
represented, with a long and particular account
of the interview, under the heading of, &ldquo;&lsquo;Why
Wallypug and wherefore of Why?&rsquo; by a Lady
of Title.&rdquo; Into it her Grace had introduced the
most preposterous and extravagant statements
about his Majesty.</p>

<p>We learned with amazement that &ldquo;The
Wallypug came of a very ancient family, and
had early been distinguished for many remarkable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
accomplishments. While at school his
Majesty displayed such a natural aptitude for
learning as to readily out-distance his instructors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&#8217;s because I said I played
Hop Scotch better than the masters,&rdquo; commented
his Majesty, to whom I was reading
the account aloud.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/img039.png" width="300" height="102" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">the faithful hound</span>
</div>

<p>Photographs of various articles in the drawing-room,
which had no connection whatever
with the Wallypug,
were reproduced
with the
most extraordinary
and absolutely
untrue stories
attached to them. Dick and Mrs. Mehetable
Murchison appeared as &ldquo;The Wallypug&#8217;s favourite
cat and dog,&rdquo; while pathetic stories were
told of how the dog had on several occasions
saved his royal master from an untimely and
watery grave, while the cat had prevented him
from being burned to death while reading in
bed by gently scratching his nose when he
had fallen asleep, and the candle had set fire
to the bed curtains. Sensational illustrations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
were also given depicting these incidents, which
of course were purely imaginary.</p>

<p>It was very remarkable to notice though,
that directly the article of the Duchess&#8217;s appeared,
invitations from all sorts of grand
people poured in upon us&mdash;and the daily
papers suddenly woke up to the fact that the
Wallypug and his suite were very important
personages, and devoted whole columns to &ldquo;Our
Mysterious Foreign Guests,&rdquo; as they called
them.</p>

<p>There was always more or less of a crowd
outside the house now, and when his Majesty
drove in the Park, the people all stood up
on the little green seats to get a better view
of him as he passed.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this that the Doctor-in-Law,
hearing what a vast fortune might
be made in literature, decided to start a magazine
of his own.</p>

<p>After a lot of argument it was thought best
to call it <em>The Wallypug&#8217;s Own</em>, as the name
was considered a striking one. The first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
number was to be a very elaborate affair, and,
for weeks before it appeared, all of my guests
were busily engaged in its production.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be a good opportunity for some
of your poems appearing at last,&rdquo; hinted the
Doctor-in-Law to the Rhymester, which so
delighted the poor little fellow that he set to
work at once upon a number of new ones.
A. Fish, Esq., contributed a very learned
article on the subject of &ldquo;The Prevalence of
Toothache amongst Fish: its Cause and Treatment&rdquo;;
while the great attraction of the number
was an historical article by the Wallypug
on the subject of &ldquo;Julius Caesar,&rdquo; illustrated
by his Majesty himself. As a special favour,
the original drawing was presented to me by
his Majesty, and I am thus enabled to reproduce
it for your benefit. His Majesty confided
to me that parts of it were traced from a
picture which appeared in the <em>Boys&#8217; Own Paper</em>
some time ago, but of course we did not tell
everybody that.</p>

</div>

<p>The essay itself was quite original, and was
worded somehow like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<em>Julius Caesar was a man, and he lived in Rome.
He came over to conquer Britain because he heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
there was a lot of tin here, and when he arrived he
said in Latin</em>, &lsquo;Veni, vidi, vici,&rsquo; <em>which means, &lsquo;I
have come, and thou wilt have to skedaddle&rsquo;, which
has been the British motto ever since. But the
Ancient Britons who lived here then, didn&#8217;t understand
Latin, and so they went for Julius Caesar, and
shook their fists in his face, and tried to drive him
and his followers away. But Julius Caesar and the
Romans were civilized, and had daggers and things,
and shields, and wore firemen&#8217;s helmets, and kilts
like Scotchmen, so they soon overcame the Ancient
Britons; and they built London Wall, and made a
lot of combs, and glass tear-bottles, and brooches, and
sarcophaguses, that you can see in the Museum at
the Guildhall; and then they went back to Rome,
and Julius Caesar was stabbed by his friend Brutus,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
to show how much he liked him; and Caesar, when
he found out he was stabbed, cried out in Latin</em>, &lsquo;Et
tu, Brute,&rsquo; <em>which means &lsquo;Oh, you brute,&rsquo; and lived
happy ever after. I have drawn the picture of Julius
Caesar landing in Britain&mdash;that&#8217;s him waving things,
and calling to the others to come on.</em>&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>The Doctor-in-Law was editor, and arranged
a number of competitions, and in order to enter
for them you had only to send two shillings in
stamps, while the prizes were advertised as
follows: First prize, &pound;1000 a year for life;
second prize, thirty-six grand pianos and fourteen
bicycles; third prize, a sewing machine and six
cakes of scented soap. The prizes were to be
awarded for the first correct answers received by
post, but the Doctor-in-Law took good care to
write three sets of answers himself, and put
them in our letter-box a half-an-hour before the
first post arrived, so that nobody got prizes but
himself. He made a good deal of money, too,
by pretending to tell your fortune by the creases
in your collar. All you had to do was to send
an old collar and fourteen penny stamps, and
you would receive a letter in reply similar to
this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are probably either a male or a female,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and will no doubt live till you die. You like
to have your own way when you can get it, and
when you can&#8217;t you get very cross and irritable.
You are not so young as you were a few
years ago, and you dislike pain of any kind.
You will remain single until you marry, and
whichever you do you will probably wish you
hadn&#8217;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The greatest novelty, however, which the
Doctor-in-Law introduced in his new magazine
was his system of telling your character by your
watch and chain. There was no fee charged,
and all you had to do was to send your watch
and chain (gold preferred), and the Doctor-in-Law
would tell your character, quite correctly.
It generally was as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a silly donkey, for no one but a
donkey would think of sending his watch and
chain to a stranger, and if you imagine that
you will ever see it again, you are greatly
mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rhymester only had one poem in after
all, as, when it came to the point, the Doctor-in-Law
charged him a guinea a verse for printing
it, and the poor Rhymester could not afford
more than one poem at that rate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
This is what he sent:</p>

<p>The poor Rhymester was very
disappointed at not being able to
publish more of his poems, so the Doctor-in-Law,
to console him, allowed him to contribute
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
an article on &ldquo;Fashions for the Month by Our
Paris Model.&rdquo; He made a frightful muddle
of it though, not knowing the proper terms
in which to describe the various materials
and styles. Here is an extract, which will
show you better than I can tell, the stupid
blunders which he made:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&ldquo;<em>Hats this season are principally worn on the head,
and may be trimmed with light gauzy stuff wobbled
round the crown mixed up with various coloured
ribbons, and bunches of artificial flowers and fruit.</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Artificial vegetables are not much worn, although
a cauliflower or two and a bunch of carrots, with a
few cabbages, would form a striking and novel decoration
for a hat. If this trimming is considered insufficient,
a few brightly coloured tomatoes stuck round the
brim might be added, and would render the head-gear
particularly &lsquo;chic.&rsquo;</em></p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Hats for the theatre should be worn large and handsomely
trimmed, but for the economically inclined&mdash;a last
year&#8217;s clothes basket trimmed with art muslin, which
may be purchased of any good draper at 1-&frac34;d. a yard,
cut on the cross and tucked with chiffons, would form
a sweetly simple hat, and if tied beneath the chin
with an aigrette, and the front filled in with sequins,
it would readily be mistaken for one of the new early
Victorian bonnets which continue to be worn by the
upper housemaids in most aristocratic families.</em></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<em>&ldquo;I hear that dresses are to be worn again this
year by ladies. The most fashionable ones will be
made of various sorts of material.</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;A charming walking costume suitable for the
Autumn may be made of shaded grenadine, trimmed
with buckram pom-poms, made up on the selvedge
edge.&rdquo;</em></p></div>

<p>There was a lot more nonsense of this kind
which I did not at all understand, but which
some lady friends who understood these things
made great fun of.</p>

<p>You will be surprised, no doubt, to hear
that in a weak moment I allowed myself to
be persuaded into contributing a little experience
of my own.</p>

<p>The Rhymester told me that it was shockingly
bad rhyme, but I think that he was
jealous because the Doctor-in-Law published
it. Anyhow, here it is, so you can judge for
yourself. I call it</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">HE and I and IT.</span></p>

<p>Even One-and-Nine and General Mary
Jane were smitten with a desire to rush into
print, and I overheard them concocting a tragic
Love Story in the kitchen, and they were
highly indignant later on, because the Doctor-in-Law
would not accept it. You can hardly
wonder at it though, for it really was too
bad for anything.</p>

<p>It was called &ldquo;The Viscount&#8217;s Revenge,&rdquo;
and in it several characters who had been
killed in the first part of the book kept
cropping up all through the story in a most
confusing manner, while One-and-Nine and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
General Mary Jane could not agree as to
whether the heroine should be dark or fair,
so in one part of the book she had beautiful
golden hair and blue eyes, and in another she
was described as &ldquo;darkly, proudly handsome,
with a wealth of dusky hair and eyes as black
as night.&rdquo;</p>

At the last moment it was found necessary
to include another poem in the magazine, and,
as all of the Rhymester&#8217;s were too long, the
Doctor-in-Law decided to write one himself,
which he called</p>

<p class="center">COMMERCIAL PROBLEMS.</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>THE WALLYPUG GOES TO WINDSOR</strong></p>


<p>While they were all busy in the preparation
of <em>The Wallypug&#8217;s Own</em>, I
thought it an excellent opportunity to run down
to Folkestone in order to make arrangements
for hiring a house, as I intended taking my
guests to the seaside for a few weeks.</p>

<p>I felt a little anxious about leaving them to
themselves, but hoped that they would be too
busy and interested in the new magazine to
get into trouble.</p>

<p>It was most unfortunate that I should have
gone just then though, for directly I had left
the Wallypug received a polite letter from one
of the Court officials to say that the Queen
would be pleased to receive his Majesty and
suite at Windsor on the following day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 259px;">
<img src="images/img047.png" width="259" height="350" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">a royal invitation</span>
</div>

<p>Of course, as you may imagine, the Wallypug
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
was in a great state of excitement at
receiving this royal invitation, and wished to
telegraph at once for me to return and advise
them how to act and what to do, on this important
occasion; however, the Doctor-in-Law,
so I have been given to understand, persuaded
his Majesty not to do anything of the sort,
and added that I &ldquo;was always poking about
and interfering, and was better out of the way&rdquo;;
so his Majesty, who was very anxious to do
the right thing, consulted Mrs. Putchy as to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the proper costume to be worn, and the
etiquette to be observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your Majesty,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Putchy
in reply, &ldquo;I scarcely know what to advise.
When in my younger days, I acted as lady&#8217;s
maid to the Countess of Wembley, I know
her ladyship wore a Court train and carried a
bouquet when she was presented to the Queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did the engine go?&rdquo; asked his
Majesty curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The engine!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Putchy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; you said she wore a train, didn&#8217;t
you?&rdquo; said the Wallypug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! but I didn&#8217;t mean that kind of train,&rdquo;
laughed Mrs. Putchy; &ldquo;I meant a long sort
of cloak fastened on to the shoulders and
trailing along the ground at the back&mdash;they
are generally made of satin and velvet, and
are decorated with flowers and feathers and
lace, and that sort of thing. Your Majesty&#8217;s
cloak would do nicely if I trimmed it for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But are you sure that gentlemen wear
these sort of things?&rdquo; inquired the Wallypug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&#8217;t rightly say, your Majesty,
but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve seen pictures of kings and
such like wearing trains which were borne by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
pages, so I feel sure your Majesty would be
safe in wearing one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was arranged that, after having been
carefully brushed, his Majesty&#8217;s velvet cloak
was to be gaily decorated with lace and large
bunches of flowers, and, to make the thing
complete, a large bouquet was tied around
his sceptre, and, at the Rhymester&#8217;s suggestion,
little knots of flowers were attached to the
knobs of his Majesty&#8217;s crown.</p>

<p>The little man was highly delighted with
his appearance when all these arrangements
were concluded, and could get but very little
sleep that night for thinking of the great
honour which was to be his the next day.</p>

<p>The whole household was early astir in
the morning, and at about eleven o&#8217;clock the
carriage came to take the royal guests to the
station.</p>

<p>Arrived at Waterloo, the Doctor-in-Law,
after making various inquiries as to the price
of the tickets, etc., actually had the meanness,
despite the remonstrance of the railway officials,
to insist upon the whole party travelling down
third-class, remarking that he &ldquo;found the
third-class carriages reached there quite as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
soon as the first, and a penny saved was a
penny gained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The station master at Windsor was particularly
put out about it, as, in honour of
his Majesty&#8217;s visit, the station had been
gaily decorated and a carpet laid down to the
carriage door. His Majesty, however, made
a brave show as he walked up the platform
preceded by the Doctor-in-Law, his gaily decorated
train borne by the Rhymester, and
followed by A. Fish, Esq., and One-and-Nine,
the latter carrying a mysterious bandbox,
which contained a present from the Wallypug
to her Majesty. (See <a href="#frontis">frontispiece</a>.)</p>

<p>Inside and out the station was crowded
with curious spectators, all eager to catch a
glimpse of his Majesty and his remarkable
retinue, and cheer after cheer resounded as
the station master, bare-headed and bowing,
ushered the party to the royal carriage with
the red and gold-liveried servants, which had
been sent from the castle to meet them.</p>

<p>The bells were ringing, and the streets
were crowded as they drove through the old
town, and his Majesty thoroughly enjoyed
the drive, while the Doctor-in-Law was quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
in his element amidst all this fuss and excitement.</p>

<p>I did not care to inquire too fully into
the details of his Majesty&#8217;s interview with
the Queen, but I was given to understand
that the whole party was treated with the
utmost kindness.</p>

<p>Her Majesty graciously accepted at the
Wallypug&#8217;s hands a gilded crown, an exact copy
of the one he wore himself, and which he had
had made expressly for her Majesty, having
been struck by the fact that her Majesty&#8217;s
real crown was always kept locked up in the
Tower, and hoping that perhaps this one
would do for second best.</p>

<p>I could not gather that her Majesty had
actually promised to wear it, but I do know
that the Wallypug was made exceedingly proud
and happy by the gift of a portrait of her
Majesty herself, with the royal autograph
attached, and that he will always remember
the occasion of his visit to Windsor, and the
kindness with which he was treated by everyone,
particularly by the little Princes and
Princesses, her Majesty&#8217;s great grand-children,
who led him about the Castle grounds, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
showed him their pets, and the flowers, and
conservatories, and all the wonderful sights of
that wonderful place.</p>

<p>In the evening there was a dinner party,
at which her Majesty did not appear, and
early the next morning a royal carriage again
drove them to the station <em>en route</em> for London.</p>

<p>All this I learned on my return from
Folkestone. I also heard of an extraordinary
evening party which had been given at my
house during my absence. It appears that
the invitations had been sent out by the
Doctor-in-Law the very day upon which I left,
and about thirty guests, including the Duchess
of Mortlake, had been invited. Unfortunately,
however, this visit to Windsor had entirely
driven the matter from the Wallypug&#8217;s mind,
and the others had forgotten about it too,
and so a pretty confusion was the result.</p>

<p>It appears that one evening about seven
o&#8217;clock they were all in the kitchen making
toffee, having persuaded Mrs. Putchy to let
them have the frying-pan and some sugar and
butter, and it having been cooking for some
time the Doctor-in-Law had just told the
Wallypug to stick his finger in and see if it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
was done, when Mrs. Putchy came in to say
that some ladies and gentlemen had arrived,
and were waiting in the drawing-room.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/img048.png" width="378" height="400" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">to see if it was done</span>
</div>

<p>All of a sudden it flashed upon their minds
that <em>this</em> was the evening upon which they
had invited their visitors to the party. Whatever
was to be done? Not the slightest preparation
had been made&mdash;and his Majesty
and the others were all more or less in a
sticky condition, and quite unfit to be seen by
company.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
A hurried consultation took place, during
which they could hear more and more guests
arriving, and at last, by a brilliant inspiration,
the Doctor-in-Law thought of making it a surprise
party, similar to those given in America.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&#8217;t cost us anything either,&rdquo; he remarked
complacently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is a surprise party?&rdquo; asked the
others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, you&#8217;ll see presently,&rdquo; remarked
the little man. &ldquo;Run and wash your hands now
and make yourselves tidy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few minutes later the whole party filed into
the drawing-room, the Wallypug looking rather
blank and nervous, and the Doctor-in-Law full
of profuse apologies for having kept the guests
waiting so long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he remarked airily, &ldquo;I suppose
you all know that it&#8217;s a surprise party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, no,&rdquo; said the Duchess of Mortlake,
speaking for the others. &ldquo;Whatever is that;
I don&#8217;t think it was mentioned on the cards
of invitation, was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! a trifling oversight,&rdquo; remarked the
Doctor-in-Law. &ldquo;A surprise party,&rdquo; he continued
in explanation, &ldquo;is one at which each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
guest is expected to contribute something towards
the supper&mdash;some bring one thing and
some another. What have you brought, may
I ask, your Grace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, really,&rdquo; said the Duchess, &ldquo;I&#8217;ve never
heard of such a thing in my life before. I&#8217;ve
not brought anything at all, of course; I&#8217;m surprised
at your asking me such a question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, just so,&rdquo; remarked the Doctor-in-Law
triumphantly, &ldquo;just what I told you&mdash;a
<em>surprise</em> party, don&#8217;t you see! Now, what I
would advise is that you should all go out and
order various things to be sent in for supper; we,
for our part, will provide some excellent toffee, and
then you can come back and help us to set the
tables and all that sort of thing, you know&mdash;it&#8217;s
the greatest fun in the world, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And really the little man carried it off with
such gaiety, that entering into the spirit of the
thing the guests really did as he suggested, and
went out and ordered the things, and afterwards
came back, and, amidst great laughter and fun,
the tables were laid, every one doing some share
of the work, with the exception of the Doctor-in-Law,
who contented himself with directing
the others and chatting to the ladies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">the wallypug helps</span>

<p>The poor dear Wallypug amiably toiled backward
and forward between the kitchen and
dining-room with great piles of plates and other
heavy articles, and A. Fish, Esq., in his eagerness
to help, was continually treading on his
own tail, upsetting himself and the various dishes
entrusted to his charge.</p>

<span class="caption">a. fish, esq., upset</span>
</div>

<p>At last, however, the supper was set, and
the merriest evening you can possibly imagine
was spent by the guests. His Majesty was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
in capital spirits, and after supper suggested
a little dancing, which suggestion was hailed
with delight by the others, and, having moved
some of the furniture out of the drawing-room
and pushed the rest away into corners, the
Wallypug led off with her Grace the Duchess
of Mortlake, and quite distinguished himself
in &ldquo;Sir Roger de Coverley.&rdquo; Afterwards
there was a little singing and music, several
of the guests contributing to the evening&#8217;s
entertainment. Amongst other items was a
song by A. Fish, Esq., rendered as well as his
bad cold would permit, of which the first
lines ran:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">

Wed you ad I had each a wooded spood, love,<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To eat our porridge wed we had a cold.</span></p>

<p>Altogether the evening was such a success
that her Grace declared that it should not be
her fault if surprise parties were not the
fashion in Society during the coming winter.</p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>HIS MAJESTY AT THE SEASIDE</strong></p>


<p>I sent Mrs. Putchy and General Mary
Jane down to the house, which I had
engaged on the &ldquo;Lees&rdquo; at Folkestone, the day
before we were to go, in order to see that
everything was ready for us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only thing that is wrong is the kitchen
chimney, and that smokes, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Putchy, in answer to my inquiry on the night
of our arrival. &ldquo;I think that we had better
have the sweep in the morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Mrs. Putchy, I&#8217;m sure you
know best,&rdquo; I replied, and thought no more
of the matter.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, however, I was
awakened by screams and cries proceeding
from the lower part of the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! help! Burglars! Fire and police!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Thieves!&rdquo; screamed a voice, and hastily dressing
myself, I rushed out into the passage, and
was confronted by the Rhymester, who had
evidently just jumped out of bed, and who,
though it was broad daylight, bore a lighted
candle in one hand, and a pair of fire tongs
in the other.</p>

<p>His teeth were chattering with fright, and
his knees were knocking together from the
same cause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&#8217;s the matter,&rdquo; I asked in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! there are burglars in the house,&rdquo;
he cried excitedly, &ldquo;and the others have gone
down to them; I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll be killed&mdash;I
told them not to go, but they would. Let&#8217;s
go and hide under a bed somewhere. Oh! oh,
what will become of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t be such a coward,&rdquo; I cried, hurrying
down stairs, while the poor little Rhymester,
afraid to be left alone upstairs, tremblingly
followed.</p>

<p>Sure enough there was a sound of struggling
going on, and voices raised in loud
dispute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that story won&#8217;t do for me,&rdquo; I heard
the Doctor-in-Law exclaim.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
&ldquo;But I tell yez, sor,&rdquo; chimed in another
strange voice, &ldquo;I waz only going to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind what you were going to do,
give up the sack,&rdquo; said the Doctor-in-Law.</p>

<p>Then there were sounds of struggling, and
amidst the confusion a voice saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold him down! Sit on him! That&#8217;s
right! Now for the sack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, bursting the door open, a curious sight
met my eyes. A poor sweep lay flat upon the
floor, with the Wallypug sitting upon him, and
One-and-Nine keeping guard; while the Doctor-in-Law
and A. Fish, Esq., examined his bag
of soot in the corner. The poor little Rhymester
summoned up sufficient courage to peep in at
the doorway, and stood there making a piteous
picture, with his white face and trembling
limbs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever is the matter,&rdquo; I inquired as
soon as I entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ve caught him!&rdquo; exclaimed his Majesty,
complacently wriggling his toes about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&#8217;s he been doing,&rdquo; I asked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;">
<img src="images/img051.png" width="454" height="500" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">&ldquo;we&#8217;ve caught him!&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Av ye plaze, sor,&rdquo; groaned the man, panting
beneath the Wallypug&#8217;s weight, &ldquo;I have
been doing nothing at all, at all. I waz just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
a-finishin&#8217; me warrak of swapin&#8217; the chimneys,
wen one ov the ould gintleman came up an&#8217;
poked me in the nose with a sthick, and the
other ould gintleman knocked me over and
sthole me bag, while the soger hild me down
till the other gintleman sat on me&mdash;it&#8217;s among
a lot of murtherin&#8217; thaves I&#8217;ve got entoirely,
savin&#8217; yer presince, sor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man is a burglar,&rdquo; declared the Doctor-in-Law
emphatically. &ldquo;I happened to hear a
very suspicious noise down here, and calling to
the others, rushed down just in time to catch
this man making off with a bag of things. I
think he was trying to escape up the chimney,
for his head was half-way up when we entered,
and this bag, which evidently contains plunder
of some kind, is covered with soot too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the man is a sweep, and was sweeping
the chimney,&rdquo; I cried, pointing to his
brushes and sticks; and after a lot of explanations
the man was told to get up and his Majesty,
followed by the others, retired to his bedroom,
evidently greatly disappointed that it was not
a real burglar that they had been combating.</p>

<p>The sweep, who was a very good-natured
Irishman, took it in very good part, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
present of half-a-crown sent him away quite
reconciled to his assailants.</p>

<p>The Rhymester afterwards made a great
boast that he had not taken any part in the
m&eacute;l&eacute;e.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I knew all along that he wasn&#8217;t
a burglar,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and that&#8217;s the reason
why I wouldn&#8217;t interfere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You managed to do a good deal of screaming
though, I noticed,&rdquo; remarked the Doctor-in-Law
grumpily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! that was only for fun,&rdquo; asserted the
Rhymester.</p>

<p>This was really about the only remarkable
incident which occurred during our holiday
at Folkestone, which passed very pleasantly
and very quietly. We went for a sea bathe
nearly every day, and his Majesty would
insist upon wearing his crown in the water on
every occasion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one will know that I am a king if I
don&#8217;t,&rdquo; he declared; and I am bound to admit
that his Majesty did not look very regal in
his bathing costume, particularly when he was
dripping with water and his long straight hair
hung half over his face, and even when he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
wore his crown he was continually catching
bits of seaweed in it, which gave him a singularly
untidy appearance for a king.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">
<img src="images/img052.png" width="434" height="450" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">his majesty did not look very regal</span>
</div>

<p>A. Fish, Esq., with the assistance of a lifebuoy,
nearly learned to swim while we were
down there; but the Doctor-in-Law thought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
that hiring bathing machines was a foolish
waste of money, and contented himself with
taking off his shoes and stockings and paddling,
which he could do without having to pay.
One day, however, he was knocked completely
over by an incoming wave, and got wet to
the skin.</p>

<p>We could never persuade the Rhymester
either, to go out further than just to his
knees; but I rather fancy that that was because
he was afraid of wetting his bathing costume,
of which he was particularly proud, and which
was decorated with smart little bows of ribbon
wherever they could be conveniently put.</p>

<p>Fear may have had something to do with
it though, for I noticed that he always clung
very tightly to the rope, and never by any
chance went beyond its length.</p>

<p>The switchback railway was a source of
infinite amusement, and a great deal of time
was spent on it. Boating was not much indulged
in, as it made one or two of the party,
particularly A. Fish, Esq., very ill; but we
all enjoyed the beautiful drives in the neighbourhood.
There was an excellent Punch
and Judy show in the town too, which so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
fascinated his Majesty that we could scarcely
tear him away whenever he joined the admiring
crowd which daily surrounded it.</p>

<p>The fickle One-and-Nine, while we were
here, fell in love with a wax figure exhibited
in a hair-dresser&#8217;s window in Sandgate Road.
It represented a beautiful lady with her hair
dressed in the latest fashion, and the wooden
soldier was greatly infatuated. He spent
hours gazing through the window, watching
the lady slowly revolve by clockwork; and he
became frightfully jealous of the hair-dresser,
whom he caught one morning rearranging the
drapery around the lady&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>Eventually, with the assistance of the
Rhymester, he composed the following piece
of poetry&mdash;which he stuck, by means of six
gelatine sweets, on to the hair-dresser&#8217;s window
with the writing inside, in order that the lady
might see it.</p>

<p class="center">TO THE BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE HAIRDRESSER&#8217;S WINDOW.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">
&#8217;Twill be the truth, for man and wife<br />
  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are one, I beg to state,</span><br />

  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or 2/6 make 8.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 12em;">

  <span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I am much distrest</span><br />
To tell you by mistake I sat<br />

<p>One-and-Nine was quite happy in finding
that the paper had disappeared from the shop
window when he passed by a little later, and
declared that it must mean that the lady had
accepted him and his poetry.</p>

<p>I think the funniest incident of all though,
in connection with our visit to Folkestone,
was when his Majesty and the others went
into Carlo Maestrani&#8217;s for some ices.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
They had never tasted any before, and were
very much surprised to find them so cold. I
shall never forget the expression on the
Wallypug&#8217;s face when, having rather greedily
taken a very large mouthful, he could not
swallow it, or dispose of it in any way.
A. Fish, Esq., declared that it gave him a
violent toothache; while the Doctor-in-Law
called for the waiter, and insisted upon him
taking it away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s not properly cooked,&rdquo; he declared
angrily. &ldquo;It&#8217;s cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cook, sare, no, sare, it is not cook,&rdquo; agreed
the waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, take it away and bring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
us some that is. Have it warmed up; do
something with it. It&#8217;s disgraceful bringing
us stuff like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And no argument or persuasion would convince
the little man that the ices were as they
should be.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>THE DEPARTURE</strong></p>


<p>We remained at Folkestone till the latter
part of September, and then returned
to London just about the time that the first
number of <em>The Wallypug&#8217;s Own</em> made its
appearance.</p>

<p>It caused quite a sensation in literary circles,
and was mentioned by most of the papers; but
it did <em>not</em> turn out a monetary success, and so
the Doctor-in-Law declared that he must devise
some other means of making money.</p>

<p>We had been once or twice to the circus, and
I fancy that it must have been his intention to
start something of the sort himself, for I caught
him one day trying to teach his Majesty to
walk the tight-rope; but as he had only tied
the rope between two very light chairs the
result was not very satisfactory, particularly to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the poor Wallypug, who came to the ground
with a terrific crash.</p>

<p>A. Fish, Esq., dressed as a clown, and
certainly looked very funny; but his bad cold
prevented him from speaking his jokes distinctly,
and so the idea was given up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img054.png" width="400" height="346" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">the result was not satisfactory</span>
</div>

<p>In fact it was not till November that the
Doctor-in-Law hit upon a plan which seemed
to give him any great satisfaction. We had
been talking a great deal about Guy Fawkes&#8217;
day and the fireworks at the Crystal Palace,
which we intended going to see in the evening,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and the Doctor-in-Law had been particularly
curious to know all about the day and its
customs. He did not say much about his plans,
but I felt sure that he was up to some of his
tricks, for I caught him several times whispering
mysteriously to the Rhymester and A. Fish,
Esq., and I noticed that they were all particularly
kind and respectful to his Majesty, as
though they wished to keep him in a good
humour.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fifth, when I came
down to breakfast, I was greatly surprised to
find that the whole party had gone out about
an hour previous, after borrowing from Mrs.
Putchy a kitchen chair, four broomsticks, and
a long piece of clothes-line. Whatever were
they up to?</p>

<p>I asked Mrs. Putchy if they had left any
message, but no&mdash;they had said nothing as to
where they were going, what they were going
to do, or when they would be back; and the
only thing that had struck Mrs. Putchy as
being at all remarkable about their appearance,
was the fact that the Rhymester had added
little bows of coloured ribbon to his costume,
and wore a tall pointed cap gaily decorated with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
streamers, and a deep white frill around his
neck&mdash;the others were dressed as usual.</p>

<p>I felt sure that some mischief was brewing,
and could not settle down to my work for
thinking of them. About eleven o&#8217;clock I went
out to see if I could find any traces of my
guests. I had been walking about unsuccessfully
for about an hour, when I heard some boys
shouting, and turning to look in their direction,
I beheld his Majesty calmly seated in a chair
which, by means of long poles attached to it,
was being carried along by the Rhymester and
A. Fish, Esq.</p>

<p>They were followed by a crowd of people
who were cheering lustily, and the Doctor-in-Law
was rushing about collecting money
in his hat, and entreating the people &ldquo;not to
forget the fifth of November,&rdquo; and repeating
some doggerel verse about:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5em;">
<span style="margin-left: -.5em;">&ldquo;Guy Fawkes guy,</span><br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stick him up high;</span><br />
 Stick him on a lamp-post,<br />
   <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there let him die,&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>while several little boys were dancing about in
great excitement, and shouting, &ldquo;Holler, boys!
holler! here&#8217;s another guy.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">a triumphal procession</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
His Majesty evidently regarded it as a great
compliment to himself, and complacently bowed
right and left with considerable dignity. And
I found out that the Doctor-in-Law had persuaded
him into believing that this triumphal
procession had been arranged solely in his
Majesty&#8217;s honour.</p>

<p>I was naturally very vexed at the poor
Wallypug being imposed upon in this manner,
and spoke very plainly to the Doctor-in-Law
about it on our way home, and I think the
little man must have taken it very much to
heart, for he seemed quite subdued, and
actually himself suggested sharing the proceeds
of the collection with the others.</p>

<p>We went to see the fireworks in the evening,
and I don&#8217;t ever remember seeing the party
in such excellent spirits as they were that
night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Putchy had prepared a capital supper
for us on our return, and I love to remember
my friends as they appeared sitting around
the supper table talking over the adventures
and excitements of the day. I can see them
now whenever I close my eyes&mdash;the dear old
Wallypug at the head of the table, with One-and-Nine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in attendance, and the others all
talking at once about the jolly time they had
had at the Skating Rink in the afternoon, when
A. Fish, Esq., had vainly tried to get along
with roller-skates fastened on to his tail.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/img056.png" width="600" height="382" alt="image" title="" />
<span class="caption">a capital story</span>
</div>

<p>I say I love to remember them thus, for
it was the last occasion upon which we were
all together. Early the next morning Mrs.
Putchy came to my room, and in a very
agitated voice said, &ldquo;Please sir, I&#8217;m afraid
that there is something wrong; I have knocked
at his Majesty&#8217;s door and can get no answer,
and the Doctor-in-Law&#8217;s room is empty too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I hurried down, and on the breakfast table
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
I found a letter addressed to me, in which
his Majesty, on behalf of the others, thanked
me very heartily for my hospitality, and explained
that State matters of the utmost
importance had necessitated their immediate
return to Why. How they went I have
never been able to discover.</p>

<p>The outer door of my flat was found to be
locked on the inside as usual, and the windows
were all fastened; besides which, as they were
some distance from the ground, the Royal
party could scarcely have got out that way.</p>

<p>Altogether the whole affair was involved in
a mystery which I have never been able to
solve to this day. Of course I miss my
strange, but withal lovable visitors, very much,
and I value very highly the several little
mementoes of their visit which remained behind.
Amongst others is a cheque of the
Doctor-in-Law&#8217;s for a considerable amount;
which, however, I shall never be able to
cash, as it is drawn upon the bank of, &ldquo;Don&#8217;t-you-wish-you-may-get-it,&rdquo;
at Why.</p>

<p>General Mary Jane was inconsolable for
some time after the departure of her soldier
hero, but eventually married our milkman, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
very steady and respectable man in the neighbourhood.
Girlie and Boy and many other
friends of the Wallypug greatly regretted that
they were unable to say good-bye to his
Majesty before he left; and often and often,
as I sit alone in my study, I think about the
simple-natured, good-hearted little fellow, and
his remarkable followers, and wonder if I
shall ever see them again. Who knows?</p>

FROM TONKIN TO INDIA. By <span class="smcap">Prince Henri of Orleans</span>.
Translated by <span class="smcap">Hamley Bent, M.A.</span> With 80 Illustrations
and a Map. <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>Crown 4to.</em></span> <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>25s.</em></span></p>

<p class="sml">The travels of Prince Henri in 1895 from China to the valley of the Bramaputra
covered a distance of 2100 miles, of which 1600 was through absolutely unexplored
country. No fewer than seventeen ranges of mountains were crossed at altitudes
of from 11,000 to 13,000 feet. The journey was made memorable by the discovery
of the sources of the Irrawaddy. To the physical difficulties of the journey were
added dangers from the attacks of savage tribes. The book deals with many of
the burning political problems of the East, and it will be found a most important
contribution to the literature of adventure and discovery.</p>


<p>THREE YEARS IN SAVAGE AFRICA. By <span class="smcap">Lionel Decle</span>.

and 5 Maps. <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>Demy 8vo.</em></span> <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>21s.</em></span></p>

<p class="sml">Few Europeans have had the same opportunity of studying the barbarous parts of
Africa as Mr. Decle. Starting from the Cape, he visited in succession Bechuanaland,
the Zambesi, Matabeleland and Mashonaland, the Portuguese settlement on
the Zambesi, Nyasaland, Ujiji, the headquarters of the Arabs, German East
Africa, Uganda (where he saw fighting in company with the late Major &lsquo;Roddy&rsquo;
Owen), and British East Africa. In his book he relates his experiences, his
minute observations of native habits and customs, and his views as to the work
done in Africa by the various European Governments, whose operations he was
able to study. The whole journey extended over 7000 miles, and occupied
exactly three years.</p>


<p>WITH THE MOUNTED INFANTRY IN MASHONALAND.
By Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Alderson</span>. With numerous Illustrations
and Plans. <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>Demy 8vo.</em></span> <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>12s. 6d.</em></span></p>

<p class="sml">This is an account of the military operations in Mashonaland by the officer who
commanded the troops in that district during the late rebellion. Besides its
interest as a story of warfare, it will have a peculiar value as an account of the
services of mounted infantry by one of the chief authorities on the subject.</p>


<p>THE HILL OF THE GRACES: <span class="smcap">or, the Great Stone
Temples of Tripoli</span>. By <span class="smcap">H. S. Cowper, F.S.A.</span> With Maps,
Plans, and 75 Illustrations. <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>Demy 8vo.</em></span> <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>10s. 6d.</em></span></p>

<p class="sml">A record of two journeys through Tripoli in 1895 and 1896. The book treats of a
remarkable series of megalithic temples which have hitherto been uninvestigated,
and contains a large amount of new geographical and arch&aelig;ological matter.</p>


<p>ADVENTURE AND EXPLORATION IN AFRICA. By
Captain A. <span class="smcap">St. H. Gibbons, F.R.G.S.</span> With Illustrations by
<span class="smcap">C. Whymper</span>, and Maps. <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>Demy 8vo.</em></span> <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>21s.</em></span></p>

<p class="sml">This is an account of travel and adventure among the Marotse and contiguous tribes,
with a description of their customs, characteristics, and history, together with the
author&#8217;s experiences in hunting big game. The illustrations are by Mr. Charles
Whymper, and from photographs. There is a map by the author of the hitherto
unexplored regions lying between the Zambezi and Kafukwi rivers and from 18&deg;
to 15&deg; S. lat.</p>

<p class="sml">This book deals with British Colonial policy historically from the beginnings of
English colonisation down to the present day. The subject has been treated by
itself, and it has thus been possible within a reasonable compass to deal with a
mass of authority which must otherwise be sought in the State papers. The
volume is divided into five parts:&mdash;(1) The Period of Beginnings, 1497-1650;
(2) Trade Ascendancy, 1651-1830; (3) The Granting of Responsible Government,
1831-1860; (4) <em>Laissez Aller</em>, 1861-1885; (5) Greater Britain.</p>

close of the Canon.</p>

<strong>Victor Hugo.</strong> THE LETTERS OF VICTOR HUGO.

<p class="sml">This is the first volume of one of the most interesting and important collection of
letters ever published in France. The correspondence dates from Victor Hugo&#8217;s
boyhood to his death, and none of the letters have been published before. The
arrangement is chiefly chronological, but where there is an interesting set of
letters to one person these are arranged together. The first volume contains,
among others, (1) Letters to his father; (2) to his young wife; (3) to his confessor,
Lamennais; (4) a very important set of about fifty letters to Sainte-Beauve; (5)
letters about his early books and plays.</p>

detailed but non-technical account is given of the instruments of modern warfare&mdash;guns,
armour, engines, and the like&mdash;with a view to determine how far we are
abreast of modern invention and modern requirements. An ideal policy is then
sketched for the building and manning of our fleet; and the last chapter is
devoted to docks, coaling-stations, and especially colonial defence.</p>

Bishop Hatfield&#8217;s Hall. <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>Demy 8vo.</em></span> <span style="margin-left: 1em;"><em>10s. 6d.</em></span></p>

<p class="sml">Mr. F. B. Jevons&#8217; &lsquo;Introduction to the History of Religion&rsquo; treats of early religion,
from the point of view of Anthropology and Folk-lore; and is the first attempt
that has been made in any language to weave together the results of recent
investigations into such topics as Sympathetic Magic, Taboo, Totemism,
Fetishism, etc., so as to present a systematic account of the growth of primitive
religion and the development of early religious institutions.</p>

<p class="sml">&lsquo;Dr. Jevons has written a notable work, and we can strongly recommend it to the
serious attention of theologians, anthropologists, and classical scholars.&rsquo;&mdash;<em>Manchester
Guardian.</em></p>

<p class="sml">&lsquo;The merit of this book lies in the penetration, the singular acuteness and force of the
author&#8217;s judgment. He is at once critical and luminous, at once just and suggestive.
It is but rarely that one meets with a book so comprehensive and so thorough as
this, and it is more than an ordinary pleasure for the reviewer to welcome and
recommend it. Dr. Jevons is something more than an historian of primitive
belief&mdash;he is a philosophic thinker, who sees his subject clearly and sees it whole,
whose mastery of detail is no less complete than his view of the broader aspects
and issues of his subject is convincing.&rsquo;&mdash;<em>Birmingham Post.</em></p>

<p class="sml">&lsquo;The tender reverence of the treatment and the imaginative beauty of the writing
have reconciled us to the daring of the conception, and the conviction is forced on
us that even so exalted a subject cannot be made too familiar to us, provided it be
presented in the true spirit of Christian faith. The amplifications of the Scripture
narrative are often conceived with high poetic insight, and this &ldquo;Dream of the
World&#8217;s Tragedy&rdquo; is, despite some trifling incongruities, a lofty and not inadequate
paraphrase of the supreme climax of the inspired narrative.&rsquo;&mdash;<em>Dublin

<p class="sml">&lsquo;To say that a book is by the author of &ldquo;Mehalah&rdquo; is to imply that it contains a
story cast on strong lines, containing dramatic possibilities, vivid and sympathetic
descriptions of Nature, and a wealth of ingenious imagery.&rsquo;&mdash;<em>Speaker.</em></p>

<p class="sml">&lsquo;That whatever Mr. Baring Gould writes is well worth reading, is a conclusion that
may be very generally accepted. His views of life are fresh and vigorous, his
language pointed and characteristic, the incidents of which he makes use are
striking and original, his characters are life-like, and though somewhat exceptional
people, are drawn and coloured with artistic force. Add to this that his
descriptions of scenes and scenery are painted with the loving eyes and skilled
hands of a master of his art, that he is always fresh and never dull, and under
such conditions it is no wonder that readers have gained confidence both in his
power of amusing and satisfying them, and that year by year his popularity
widens.&rsquo;&mdash;<em>Court Circular.</em></p>

<p class="sml">&lsquo;In the weirdness of the story, in the faithfulness with which the characters are
depicted, and in force of style, it closely resembles &ldquo;Mehalah.&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;<em>Daily Telegraph.</em></p>

<p class="sml">&lsquo;There is a kind of flavour about this book which alone elevates it above the ordinary
